# Outlander
### A survival and roleplaying modlist for the Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind
**Outlander** is focused on immersing yourself into the island of Vvardenfell and mainland Morrowind with enhanced gameplay, improved graphics, and new mechanics for roleplaying and survival. Includes some of the best mods the community has to offer. **Outlander** is a spiritual successor to my old list **You Are Just an N'wah**. Simply download through Wabbajack, update MWSE, and run Morrowind through MO2.
