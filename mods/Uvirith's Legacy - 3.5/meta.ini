The Tower:\n<br />*****************************************************************************\n<br />The entire interior of Tel Uvirith has been massively upgraded. It is more detailed and expansive, and has many new areas:\n<br />The Lower Tower:\n<br />Impress guests with its grandeur -- the grand entrance has alcoves for display mannequins (not provided).\n<br />Contains a bath, servant's quarters, and a storage room.\n<br />   The Tower Bath:\n<br />   Fully compatible with the Bathing Mod 2.0, you will find a Telvanni Bathing Crystal here for the purpose. Bathing Mod 3.0 is only compatible with an add-on like the Stinker 2.0 to 3.0 Upgrader (included with this mod).\n<br />   The Servant's Quarters:\n<br />   Contains NoM compatible items and a cook who will offer NoM compatible meals.\n<br />   This area is now fully compatible with NoM 3.0. A backwards compatibility patch is available in the add-ons folder for NoM 2.13 players.\n<br />   The Storage Room:\n<br />   This room contains weekly respawning shipment containers. It is not intended as a place to deposit your loot.\n<br />   Hire a steward, and he will bring in weekly ingredient shipments. They will no longer disappear after the week is up. Instead, more ingredients will be added to the existing containers once they're paid for.\n<br />   You can expand these shipments through a quest series, however the shipment's cost will increase as you secure more supply lines.\n<br />   This is ultimately intended as a late game money sink that offers a bit of convenience to the player in acquiring basic alchemical necessities.\n<br />   NEW: An option to add mod-added ingredients is available after completing the Bloodmoon shipments quest.\n<br />   Ingredients from NoM, The Bathing Mod, and the Tea Mod are included in the base mod.\n<br />   TR ingredients are added in the TR add-on. THESE ARE EXPENSIVE -- more than twice the original shipment cost. That's why I've added the choice to stop mainland shipments (doesn't affect the Mournhold ones), or resume them at any time.\n<br />   If you complete Master Mithras' quest-line, he'll slip some extra ebony in the TR shipments as a bonus (which can help offset their massive cost if you sell them).\n<br />   Also, you now leave money with Almossaren in the storage strongbox instead of paying him directly every week.\n<br />   Don't worry if you're gone for a couple weeks. It will only cost you on the weeks you enter the storage room.\n<br />   NEW: Added more storage to the lower tower, accessible with the Tel Uvirith Key, which you now get earlier.\n<br />   The Tower Travel Ring is also given at the same time as the key rather than left lying around the tower. This means you can get it before you even visit the tower by talking to Llunela after it's built.\n<br />The Upper Tower:\n<br />Massively expanded into a lush wizard's den.\n<br />The dining room and bedroom have not been significantly altered. Instead, I added new turrets and a hidden lab.\n<br />   The Tower Elevator:\n<br />   A switch in the doorways to the levitation corridor raises the platform to any level of the tower.\n<br />   The Tel Uvirith key is required to use these switches, acquired from Llunlela in the Council House or from one of your retainers outside Tel Uvirith.\n<br />   Another switch on the second floor reveals hidden treasure alcoves.\n<br />   The Secret Lab:\n<br />   Acquire more magical artifacts for your lab through quests.\n<br />   Fast Eddie's chores will start quests for an alchemy sorter table, the Bag of Holding, and enchanting and spellmaking service books.\n<br />   Two more quests are available to acquire inscription quills, and a weather control device for the region.\n<br />   NEW: The lab now has a scroll rack as well as an upgraded potion rack. 3.1 upgrades it further.\n<br />   The Throne Room:\n<br />   Available once you build the tower vault. You can even hold court here during certain quests.\n<br />   The Guest Room:\n<br />   Another turret, designed for atmosphere. The chess add-on for UL adds a working chess board to the game table.\n<br />   The Atrium:\n<br />   This alchemy garden contains a magical waterfall. Drinking from this font with the Telvanni Magicka Cup (found in the lab) will replenish your magicka.\n<br />   NEW: the Telvanni Teleportation Platform has been moved out of the lab onto the second floor of the shaft.\n<br />   The lab has been moved to its own cell, still found at the bottom of the shaft.\n<br />   NEW: You can now customize the rugs and your bed in the upper tower in-game.\n<br />   Get Meiree to change the bed for you, or just grab the covers yourself.\n<br />   Order a rug change using the form in the storage room. This does cost money, but you can now leave money in the storage room chest and it will automatically go towards tower costs.\n<br />   If you take money out of the chest, leaving not enough for the rug order, your order will be cancelled.\n<br />   You can choose to get the rugs changed next week, or the next day at a greater cost.\n<br />The Tower Dungeon:\n<br />Split into the main dungeon, the deep tunnels, and the vault.\n<br />   The Main Dungeon:\n<br />   Randomly spawns rats, other creatures, adventurers, and escaping slaves.\n<br />   The dungeon hounds attack random spawns.\n<br />   Activate the two switches, found in the center of each cage wall, to release the hounds.\n<br />   If you abolish slavery in the tower, the slave spawns will be deactivated.\n<br />   The Deep Tunnels:\n<br />   Contains the slave pens, a winged twilight trader, and many secret areas.\n<br />   A quest found in the vault will reveal the deep tunnels' hidden areas.\n<br />   The winged twilight trader is involved in a couple quests -- don't remove her if you don't want a creature trader, just remove her services in the CS.\n<br />   NEW: The dungeon slaves have a quest involving moonsugar/skooma. You can choose to abolish it from the tower (as well as abolishing slavery), or get Almossaren to arrange shipments with smugglers and get it delivered to your tower.\n<br />The Vault:\n<br />Available as a separate stronghold build after you attain the rank of Archmagister.\n<br />The vault contains a huge treasury, library, and prison.\n<br />   The Library:\n<br />   The automatic book sorter -- talk to the librarian and ask him to \"organize books\".\n<br />   He will remove all books from your inventory and place them in one of two book closets or a small chest for scrolls.\n<br />   Copies of all sorted books will appear on the center shelves of the library.\n<br />   The library also has extra space for mod-added books.\n<br />   NEW: The TR patch adds all the TR books to the library book sorter.\n<br />   Also, a new area has been added to the library, just for fun.\n<br />   A secret passage in the library leads to hidden areas. Press the switch beside the sliding bookcase to reveal them.\n<br />   Behind the passage is the librarian's chambers, where he will sometimes be randomly found.\n<br />   Halfway down the shaft is a secret annex to contain any documents you wish to keep hidden from prying eyes. Important Telvanni documents will be sorted here. Another switch is used to hide this area.\n<br />   Uvirith's Tomb, the source of many new quests, lies at the bottom of the shaft.\n<br />   The Treasury:\n<br />   The treasury has plenty of storage and two levels. The second level, accessed in the passages below by secret elevator, contains display cases.\n<br />   A quest related silver display is on the main floor. It cannot be picked up until after the related quest is initiated.\n<br />   A hidden switch will open up the mannequin alcoves on the main floor.\n<br />   A hidden secret will begin a new quest. Examine the artifacts left here for you.\n<br />   NEW: The treasury has been expanded with more display cases and a high-security vault.\n<br />   Have fun getting into the vault the first time. ;)\n<br />   The Prison:\n<br />   Has three sections: the main prison, the high security prison, and the barracks.\n<br />   Your warden Trenam Faren has quests involving the prisoners found in your cells.\n<br />   Each prisoner has their own quest, and new prisoners will occasionally arrive.\n<br />   The high security prison is mage and daedra proof. The empty cells are reserved for quest related captures.\n<br />   You cannot levitate or teleport here, due to magic dampeners. This prison is designed to hold mages after all.\n<br />   The barracks provide a few services including repair, a bartender in the mess hall, and a training room with targetable practice dummy.\n<br />   The bathroom here is also compatible with the Bathing Mod.\n<br />   NEW: The prison now has a torture chamber with some amusing/disturbing items.\n<br />   Trenam Faren has a couple new (minor) quests, and Durza has a ton of new dialogue.\n<br />Uvirith's Tomb:\n<br />I will not say much about this area so as not to spoil it for any new players.\n<br />The tomb is a small dungeon crawl with some decent (not too overpowered) loot and many new quests.\n<br />NEW: Lord Uvirith is now a proper (unique) lich.\n<br />*****************************************************************************\n<br />II. Special Items:\n<br />*****************************************************************************\n<br />NEW ROBES:\n<br />   Robe of the Archmagister:\n<br />   This robe has a reflexive shield (idea courtesy of Ortorin). If you get hit, a 10 second shield will prop, protecting you from further attacks of that kind.\n<br />   He also has a pair of highly-enchantable gloves.\n<br />   If you kill Gothren before loading this mod, you'll find the new clothes in the strongbox along with the Seal.\n<br />   I also simulate the robe's effect on Gothren, so hopefully he'll be a tougher fight.\n<br />   Telvanni Servitor Robe:\n<br />   Master Aryon will give you one of these as you rise in the ranks (but not once you become Archmagister, because they're beneath your status at that point).\n<br />   Once you become Archmagister, you can buy these robes from the clothier in Tel Mora or the enchanter in the Telvanni Council House and give them to any Telvanni of the rank Oathman or higher (but not the Masters, naturally).\n<br />   There are two kinds, the regular Servitor Robe and the Grand Servitor Robe. The visual difference is in the built-in pauldrons, but the disposition difference in NPCs wearing them is where those bronze pauldrons really shine.\n<br />   Aryon's Dominator and Helper have been converted into servitor gloves. If you prefer other replacers, load them after UL.\n<br />   Be warned, if you wear the servitor robe after becoming Archmagister, people will comment on you wearing a robe beneath your station.\n<br />   Also, the robe will cover whatever pauldrons you're wearing. You can still wear them, but they won't show up. Same goes for the Archmagister's Robe.\n<br />Travel Options:\n<br />   The Telvanni Teleport System:\n<br />   Akin to guild guides, these use scripted teleport platforms to call magical doors.\n<br />   Every Telvanni tower has a platform, including Tel Uvirith.\n<br />   You must travel to each tower to unlock its platform before you can use it. A special key is required.\n<br />   You can get the key from Llunla Hleran in the Council House at any point after attaining the rank of Oathman. The topic will become available after attempting to activate a platform.\n<br />   The Tower Travel Ring:\n<br />   As your tower is built you will be able to teleport to new areas of your tower. This is now given to you along with the tower key.\n<br />   The Telvanni Travel Slippers:\n<br />   You will find these in your bedroom in the upper tower.\n<br />   The shoe's levitation effect only works in or near Telvanni towers.\n<br />   NEW: A Telvanni Levitation Belt has been added for those of you who'd prefer not to use the shoes. It works exactly the same way.\n<br />   NEW: You can now build a teleportation device to the Vivec Telvanni Canton. Completing the quest will add one to Vivec, your tower, and the Telvanni Council House.\n<br />The Secret Lab:\n<br />   The Alchemy Table:\n<br />   This table will sort your ingredients into a single container.\n<br />   It is available after completing a quest: ask Eddie about chores.\n<br />   Sri's Alchemy compatibility is included in the main mod.\n<br />   The MWSE patch sorts all ingredients regardless of mods.\n<br />   The Bag of Holding:\n<br />   A portable container, much like CDCooley's portable containers, will allow you to access a larger container from your inventory.\n<br />   Available after completing a quest, ask Eddie about chores.\n<br />   The MWSE add-on improves the bag's functionality, making it possible to restore the link from anywhere, including interiors, on reload or after the 72 hour cleanup takes effect.\n<br />   Inscription Quills:\n<br />   Allows you to create magical scrolls.\n<br />   Ask your apprentice about chores to get the inscription table, opening further quests to acquire all necessary quills.\n<br />   I've overhauled this quest in version 3.1. If you've already done the quest in 3.0, you'll have to do the rituals to get them back. Materials you've already given to Master Llapp will count toward the new quest.\n<br />   The Weather Control Device:\n<br />   Allows you to modify the weather for the region around your tower.\n<br />   A quest to build this device is started after completing one of the vault quests.\n<br />   The Tomes of Knowledge:\n<br />   These offer half-cost enchanting and spellmaking services.\n<br />   Send Eddie on a chore to acquire both tomes.\n<br />   Palantir: This is just a fun/creepy item. Go on, touch it.\n<br />Other Magical Items:\n<br />   The Books of Daedric Summoning:\n<br />   Handling or reading these books will call forth an angry daedra, which will attack the player.\n<br />   The books and pages are scattered throughout the game world.\n<br />   Quests are available regarding these rare books.\n<br />   The Nifty Magical Rock Dingus:\n<br />   Turn NPCs into rocks!\n<br />   The rocks can still walk, talk, and fight. Rock NPCs will beg you to change them back.\n<br />   A quest reward, info on how to get it is available on the UL web site. I don't want to spoil it for new players.\n<br />   Once you have your rock wand, the dialogue topic \"You are now a rock!\" changes the NPC into a rock.\n<br />   The MWSE add-on, makes it a spell instead -- the dialogue system is overridden.\n<br />   You cannot change all NPCs into rocks. Powerful wizards and such will not be effected, determined by willpower in the MWSE version.\n<br />Portable Chests:\n<br />   You'll find twelve different types of portable chests around the tower, six inlaid wood and six bronze.\n<br />   Inside each chest is an icon of that chest. If you transfer the icon to your inventory, you'll pick up the chest.\n<br />   Make sure you empty it first, or you'll lose your stuff.\n<br />   Dropping the chest in the game world will convert it back into a chest again.\n<br />   The first time you activate it, it will give you options to adjust its position.\n<br />   After that, it works like a regular chest until you pick it up again.\n<br />   Note: not all of these chests are portable (for example if they're owned by an NPC). Only the portable ones have chest icons in them.\n<br />*****************************************************************************\n<br />III. Tower Staff:\n<br />*****************************************************************************\n<br />All tower staff have schedules. For essential NPCs, these schedules can be turned off using a special bell-pull found in the lower tower and vault entrances.\n<br />Pulling the bell will wake any sleeping NPCs and disable NPC schedules for a day.\n<br />Pulling the bell while sneaking will pop up a menu allowing you to disable schedules completely for essential NPCs or turn them on again.\n<br />If you change your staff into vampires using Vampire Embrace, their schedules and dialogue will be altered accordingly.\n<br />   Edd Theman:\n<br />   Fast Eddie has tons of new quests and dialogue.\n<br />   He will inform you about new developments in the council, offer to set you up with an apprentice, and run many new chores for you.\n<br />   After he's completed the original chores, the topic will bring up new quests. Eddie will inform you about new magical items you can acquire, and offer to run errands in to aid you in finding or building them.\n<br />The Main Tower:\n<br />   Almossaren:\n<br />   Your tower steward is in charge of bringing in supplies to your tower.\n<br />   After you hire Almossaren, he will arrive in your tower storage room.\n<br />   Read the note left on the storage room desk to begin the quest to hire him.\n<br />   You can only change Almossaren into a vampire in the storage room, as the scheduled sleeping Almossaren is a different version of this NPC.\n<br />   Salmeama:\n<br />   Your tower cook offers four NoM compatible meals a day.\n<br />   You can pick a specific meal, or take the random selection she offers that day.\n<br />   She will only offer meals once for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and a late night snack. You must wait until the next meal time to ask for another.\n<br />   Meiree:\n<br />   You will find her sweeping your tower in the daytime and in her room at night.\n<br />   NEW: now Meiree will make your bed whenever you ask her.\n<br />   If you change Meiree into a vampire, her behavior will alter -- considerably.\n<br />   You cannot change the sweeper version into a vampire. You must wait until she's in her room for the night.\n<br />   Amsemasa:\n<br />   The household slave, you have the option to set her free using the key found near the slave pens in the deep tunnels.\n<br />   If you choose to set her free, you can ask Almossaren to make your tower slave free.\n<br />\n<br />The Vault:\n<br />   Netheles Berom:\n<br />   Your librarian will sort and copy all books in your inventory for the library's permanent collection.\n<br />   He has many amusing opinions on the books found in Morrowind.\n<br />   Trenam Faren:\n<br />   Your prison warden offers new quests regarding the prisoners in your dungeon.\n<br />   NEW: In version 3.0, he also has some new quests regarding himself.\n<br />   Merana Relas:\n<br />   Found in the barracks training room, she offers some training, and repair services.\n<br />   You can ask her to leave the training room to practice alone, or ask her for a short demonstration of her skills.\n<br />   Durza gra-Grathmok:\n<br />   Found in the barracks mess hall, she offers drinks for sale and has some amusing dialogue opinions.\n<br />The original Tel Uvirith retainers, found outside the tower in their homes, have not been altered much by this mod to avoid incompatibilities with LGNPC Tel Uvirith.\n<br />The LGNPC slave in the upper tower is also unaltered by UL.\n<br />However, she will no longer complain about the food and offer stale bread and ash yams. You'll have to go to the kitchen to get a nice meal instead.\n<br />NEW: You can now reward all tower staff members (save the generic guards). Some will only accept specific items though. It's up to you to discover what those are. In version 3.2, all your tower retainers will keep the gold you give them. Meiree and Salmeama will upgrade their wardrobe as you give them money, up to three times. Almossaren will upgrade his wardrobe once, if you give him enough money.\n<br />*****************************************************************************\n<br />IV. Companions:\n<br />*****************************************************************************\n<br />There are three major companions available in this mod, as well as a few minor ones.\n<br />All major companions have tons of dialogue, quests, telepathy rings, following and teleportation scripting, and can return to pre-designated meeting spots.\n<br />Apprentice Gavyn:\n<br />   Eddie will eventually ask you if you're looking for an apprentice, at which point you can choose to hire him or not.\n<br />   If you choose to hire him, you have the opportunity to test him first: you can ask him to fight you, or send him on a chore.\n<br />   Once hired, he'll perform chores for you. Most are not offered in the chores dialogue, but new topics as they become available.\n<br />   You can change your apprentice into a vampire. If you're using Vampire Embrace, then this must be done using the Embrace option.\n<br />   If you're not using VE, but happen to be a vampire, you will have to fight Gavyn to test him. This will cause him to contract the blood disease, and he will become a vampire in three days.\n<br />   Non-vampire players can still change him into a vampire through a series of \"vampire research\" quests. This is started by finding a specially scripted copy of the Vampires of Vvardenfell in the vault library.\n<br />   You can train your apprentice in many spells.\n<br />   Tell him what type of spell you're going to teach him, then cast that spell type and he will learn it.\n<br />   Teaching him spells will increase his attributes in that particular school. He will have to reach a certain level before he can learn higher level spells.\n<br />   Gavyn will also level naturally as he travels with you.\n<br />Sara N'tashra:\n<br />   Sara is a high priestess of Azura and quite the fighter. You will find her hidden in a secret area of the dungeon after completing a quest series.\n<br />   Sara has been massively upgraded since her raw beginnings in Uvirith Inside. Aside from her more advanced scripting, she's had tons of dialogue added to flesh out her character.\n<br />   Introducing her to certain people in your tower will start a couple minor quests.\n<br />Ash-Kosh Virash:\n<br />   This dremora companion will join you at some point during the Uvirith's Tomb quest line and eventually become a full companion.\n<br />   The dremora will resurrect if dead, but will leave you for good if it becomes bored. You will have to keep it sufficiently entertained somehow.\n<br />   All armor and weapons are bound to this companion and cannot be taken. However, you can ask it to banish its gear if you want.\n<br />   You can also banish Ash-Kosh at any time, and reclaim it later using the telepathy ring.\n<br />   Ash-Kosh starts off as an unusual female dremora lord. Once she is your full companion, you can ask her to change gender at any time. She will disappear for a week and return a new ... man?\n<br />   Ash-Kosh is an NPC companion, using Miltiades' dremora race.\n<br />   Keep in mind, if you send Ash-Kosh away to change gender, any items will remain in the inventory of whichever version you gave them to.\n<br />   IMPORTANT! Should Ash-Kosh die, you will lose any items he or she is carrying, as the ressurection script resets an NPC's inventory. I have given the resurrection timer enough time so that you can loot Ash-Kosh before he or she resurrects, but try to be quick about it.\n<br />Primus Pilus:\n<br />   This is an advanced steam centurion available from Baladas Demnevanni after completing a certain quest involving him.\n<br />   Primus Pilus has been upgraded to a full companion. He now has a summoning ring and teleport scripting, and can be sent back to the tower on command. He also offers a repair service.\n<br />   Primus can be repaired by offering him scrap metal, or an auto-repair function can be turned on in dialogue. Once auto-repair is on, he will automatically remove scrap metal from his inventory (if he has it) to repair himself.\n<br />   Should Primus be destroyed in combat, you can remove his head and take it back to Hlendrisa Seleth (your retainer designated as an expert in Dwemer construction by LGNPC) to have him repaired.\n<br />   It will take quite a few resources and a couple weeks to complete his repairs, after which a new Primus will appear in your tower.\n<br />   Primus also comes with his own MWSE add-on. This is still considered beta. See the add-ons section for more details.\n<br />   NEW: Primus has a new personality chip. If it annoys the hell out of you, you can ask Baladas to remove it.\n<br />   Now people have more to say about Primus when he's around.\n<br />Minor Companions:\n<br />   The Tower Centurions:\n<br />   The centurions have basic follow scripting that also allows them to levitate and teleport back to the tower.\n<br />   You can also repair these centurions so long as you have enough scrap metal on hand.\n<br />   You can set the position of these centurions anywhere in the main tower, and they will return to that position when ordered to.\n<br />   You can also repair these centurions should they die, in the same way you would repair Primus.\n<br />   Verena Uvirith:\n<br />   She is not a full companion. Rather, she is your potential tower mistress.\n<br />   She does however have Companion Share and proper follow scripting for her escort sequences.\n<br />   If you have escorted Verena to your tower and decided she's just not right for you, then there are options to get rid of her.\n<br />   Talking to the tower staff will reveal just what kind of woman is running your tower while you're away.\n<br />   If you ask certain NPCs about marriage under the Verena topic, you can start a quest to try to marry her off to someone.\n<br />   Ra'Sha: NEW for version 3.0\n<br />   Found in the dungeon with the other slaves, Ra'Sha will choose to stay on as a paid servant if you abolish slavery in the tower.\n<br />   However, she will leave with the rest if you ever feed another slave skooma. The only way to regain her approval after doing so is to refuse the other slaves skooma enough to compensate, or abolish skooma from the tower completely.\n<br />   Ra'Sha also gives the quest to abolish skooma from the tower (though skooma abolishment can be started otherwise if you let your slave's skooma use get out of control).\n<br />   Ra'Sha is an old Argonian, so though she has basic follow scripting and Companion Share (as all the slaves do), she's a weak companion. She'd much rather stay in the tower.\n<br />*****************************************************************************\n<br />V. Zhariphel Mine:\n<br />*****************************************************************************\n<br />Zhariphel is the last remaining bloat mine in Vvardenfell. Telvanni owned, your faction needs help to quell a growing blight inside the mine.\n<br />Your librarian will ask you to retrieve the new Brown Book from Eddie (detailing your conquests on your way to becoming Archmagister), after which can start a quest to save the last remaining bloat mine in Vvardenfell.\n<br />After completing this first quest, you will receive a reward from Eddie. Reading the note from Master Galdin (the head of the mine) will give you a travel ring to Zhariphel and open up a new quest series.\n<br />Every NPC in Zhariphel has schedules, lots of dialogue, and their own underground housepods in the Zhariphel Warrens.\n<br />The people of Zhariphel offer basic services for the traveler including repair services, ingredients and potions for sale, and a trader who sells NoM survival gear.\n<br />The town of Zhariphel also offers a training room with practice dummy, and a Bathing Mod compatible bath house.\n<br />There is also a teleport to the Telvanni Council House in Galdin Manor. The Telvanni Teleport key is required to use it.\n<br />The people of Zhariphel want to build a council house in their little underground town. As you help them build this, you can watch the tower grow over time. Eventually, they will even rename the tower in your honor.\n<br />Once the council house is built, you have an option to start a quest to find a publican for the house, who will also sell drinks, NoM compatible meals, and soaps for use in the bath for Bathing Mod compatibility.\n<br />*****************************************************************************\n<br />VI. Some notes about the quests and rewards:\n<br />*****************************************************************************\n<br />   Most quests are written for a hard-lined Telvanni, so they're a little skewed towards the dark side.\n<br />   You don't have to pick the evil choices of course, but the mod is much more fun that way.\n<br />   It is entirely possible to play through the whole mod as a neutral or good character.\n<br />   If this is the case, don't worry about missing out on the more evil quests (there's only a couple). They're designed as role-playing options, so there's no need to complete everything in the mod. You can still benefit from everything the tower has to offer without them.\n<br />   Most importantly, I've kept this mod as lore friendly as possible -- oh, who am I kidding. I drop lore for humor in a second. It's still pretty lore friendly though. Beth added tons of silly bits to the original game.\n<br />   Most quests are non-linear, time-based, and integrated into other quests. They're written for role-players, not power gamers. This means:\n<br />   Characters involved will only tell you where to go and what to do to the best of their knowledge.\n<br />   Sometimes you have to wait for things to happen in the background; a missing a puzzle piece will fall into place as you do other things.\n<br />   Some quests can be started right away, but their continuation relies on completing (or at least getting to a certain logical point in) other pre-requisite quests.\n<br />   I realize this may be frustrating to some. A full walkthrough is available on the UL website. If you have further questions, the still-very-much-alive Morrowind community is full of people who have completed runs through this mod.\n<br />   Quest rewards are meant to be unique, interesting, collectible, and suitable for a high-ranking Telvanni, but not too overpowered.\n<br />   I have tried to carefully balance all items in this mod. I have removed some loot present in previous versions, and rebalanced the rest according to feedback from beta players.\n<br />   I have minimized rewards giving the player things like stat boosts or destructive power. Such things can be acquired by many other means.\n<br />   Sometimes rewards will be meager, the reward being the journey itself.\n<br />   Sometimes you will end up paying out more gold to complete a quest than you get in returns. These things are meant to be a money sink, such as your stronghold build. The value you get out of it is non-monetary.\n<br />   Many rewards are scripted items that allow you to do things not ordinarily available in the game, such as the weather control device or the rock transformation dingus.\n<br />   This mod is not meant to expand the world political scope of the Telvanni, as such things are already covered in RoHT.\n<br />   If you want to start a massive faction war so you can defend your tower, then a new mod would be more appropriate to cover that.\n<br />For Non-Telvanni:\n<br />   This mod is designed for the Telvanni faction, so most content is not available to non-Telvanni.\n<br />   However, if you're Redoran or Hlaalu, and just want to raid a cool tower, ok. I've added some features for you.\n<br />\xa0   Tel Uvirith is a bit tougher to raid. The centurions will attack and so will the dungeon hounds, making it a more interesting challenge.\n<br />   Regular tower staff won't be welcoming, but weaker servants won't attack. No, sorry, they won't accept you as their new master if you raid the tower and decide to make it your own. If you want that, make an add-on for it.\n<br />   The vault will not be built, since Raynel Uvirith is not the Archmagister.\n<br />   Quests will not start that cannot be completed by non-Telvanni.\n<br />*****************************************************************************\n<br />VII. Customizing the Tower and Companions:\n<br />*****************************************************************************\n<br />You are free to customize this mod for personal use. It's your home after all, so feel free to move the furniture around or replace it, just be careful about moving scripted elements like the tower elevator, as you could potentially break things.\n<br />As for customizing the characters, there are some notes about customizing armor included in the UL_Modder'sGuide.txt.\n<br />All companions (Verena included) are using Better Heads models. However, I have had one player running the game with no graphics replacers, who found these heads immersion breaking when all other characters had Beth's original models. In this is the case, replace the heads with original ones.\n<br />   If you want to replace their heads to change their appearance, feel free to do so.\n<br />   Find a head you like, make a copy of it, renaming it to match the filename of Gavyn's, Sara's, or Verena's original head, and replace the old file with the new one. Make sure to back up the original heads, just in case.\n<br />Note: If you want to change Sara's hair, you must also change her tiara, which has to include her hair mesh so she's not bald while wearing it.\n<br />   This requires a bit of work in NifSkope. Refer to the UL_Modder'sGuide.txt.\n<br />*****************************************************************************\n<br />VIII. Additional Add-ons Included:\n<br />*****************************************************************************\n<br />All add-ons included with this mod have been re-dated to make sure they load after the UL main file.\n<br />All add-ons have been cleaned with EE, as some required special care. Do not clean these with TESTool.\n<br />Make sure the additional requirements are met before loading any of these add-ons.\n<br />UL MWSE add-on:\n<br />File: UL_3.5_MWSE_Add-on.esp, UL_MWSE_Companions.esp\n<br />Requires: The latest stable build of MWSE, MGE. or MGE XE.\n<br />   Adds MWSE scripting to a few things already present in UL.\n<br />   Improves the companion's teleport scripting.\n<br />   Improves the alchemy table so all ingredients, modded or otherwise, can be added to the sorting table.\n<br />   Improves the Bag of Holding so the bag access link can be restored from interiors.\n<br />   Improves the Rock Wand and turns it into a spell, removing all reliance on dialogue to change NPCs into rocks.\n<br />   A separate readme is included for further info.\n<br />   NEW: This add-on has been split between the companion scripts and the other stuff, so you have to choice to use Melian's Teleportation Mod instead and still get the improved tower goodies.\n<br />UL Primus MWSE Patch\n<br />File: UL_Primus_MWSE.esp\n<br />Requires: The latest stable build of MWSE or MGE\n<br />   Adds improved teleport scripting to Primus.\n<br />   Allows you to call him from anywhere, and teleport with you anywhere, barring end-game cells and other places with teleportation bans in effect.\n<br />   This is separate from the main MWSE patch because it is still a beta.\n<br />Tamriel Rebuilt Add-on:\n<br />File: UL_3.5_TR_16.09.10_Add-on.esp\n<br />Requires: TR_data.esm plus TR_mainland.esm\n<br />   Adds TR ingredients to the tower shipments (optional). Does not add them to the ingredient sorter, because those old clunky scripts suck and enough people run MGE/MGE XE that you really have no excuse for not using the MWSE patch anymore, which covers all modded ingredients.\n<br />   Adds TR books to the library book sorter.\n<br />   Adds new teleportation platforms to most TR towers and quests to build/repair some of them.\n<br />   If you've never been to Telvannis and joined mainland House Telvanni, Eddie will give you an introduction letter from Master Mithras after you finish saving Zhariphel.\n<br />   If you get the letter, you get one free teleport to Port Telvannis (by bothering Dratha). From there you'll need to join their House Telvanni to get a Telvannis platform key.\n<br />   Check your UL and TR version number before loading this add-on. Make sure you unload older ones.\n<br />   A separate readme is included for further info.\n<br />RoHT Compatibility patches:\n<br />File: UL_3.5_RoHT_1.52_Compatibility.esp\n<br />Requires: RoHT\n<br />   Adds RoHT books to the library book sorter.\n<br />   Adds teleport platforms to all towers added by RoHT.\n<br />   Adds levitation to the Telvanni Travel Slippers within the RoHT towers.\n<br />   NEW: added the option to invite Folms Mirel to Tel Uvirith if you destroy the Mages Guild. If you use the Master Index Plug-in, this gives you access to all the Dunmer strongholds from home.\n<br />   Not required for RoHT compatibility. UL functions perfectly well with RoHT without it.\n<br />   The latest RoHT add-on includes tweaks to RoHT requested by Telvanni players, since RoHT won't likely be updated again. This includes:\n<br />      - Visual improvements to the Archmagister's Chambers in the Telvanni Council House\n<br />      - Moving Ajira to Tel Dwemeris to act as Edwinna's alchemist. Saving Ajira from the destruction of the Mages Guild was a popular request. She won't show up at the tower if you kill her though.\n<br />   Check your UL and RoHT version number before loading this add-on. Make sure you unload older ones.\n<br />   This is compatible with any UL version 3.0 and higher.\n<br />   A separate readme is included for further info.\n<br />Soralis' Chess add-on for UL:\n<br />File: UL_chess_addon.esp\n<br />Requirements: None.\n<br />   Adds a working chess board to the Upper Tower.\n<br />   The UL chessboard has been re-textured to better suit Telvanni decor.\n<br />   Fully compatible with other versions of the Chess mod. These are not required.\n<br />   A separate readme is included for further info.\n<br />Amberfire's Book Jackets Add-on:\n<br />File: Uvirith's Legacy Book Jackets Add-on.esp\n<br />Requires: Book Jackets Morrowind, Tribunal, and Bloodmoon\n<br />   Adds compatibility with Book Jacket's in the sorted books in the Library.\n<br />   Not required for compatibility, but will make the sorter books look much better.\n<br />   Special thanks to Amberfire for taking the time to make this.\n<br />The Lighting Mod Ambiance Fix:\n<br />File: UL_TLM_ambiance.esp\n<br />Recommended: The Lighting Mod\n<br />   Alters the ambiance of all the new cells added by UL so that they look good with TLM loaded.\n<br />   If this add-on makes your tower too dark, this means you don't need the TLM ambiance changes, so unload this add-on.\n<br />Uvirith's Legacy CoM add-on:\n<br />File: Uvirith's Legacy CoM Add-on.esp\n<br />Requires: Children of Morrowind\n<br />   Turns Apprentice Gavyn and Servant Meiree into teenagers, as they were always kind of intended to be.\n<br />   This is not required for CoM compatibility.\n<br />   Now adds CoM books to library book sorter as well.\n<br />Weapon Rotate add-on:\n<br />File: UL_WeaponRotate_Addon.esp\n<br />Requires: Weapon Rotate\n<br />   This add-on does not replace the few weapon racks in the prison barracks, or touch anything added by UL. It simply adds tons of WR racks to Tel Uvirith.\n<br />   You'll find over 60 table racks around the tower. Most are in the treasury for use in your many display cases. Since they're portable, you can pick up the ones you don't need and store them in a container.\n<br />   You'll find a few larger racks in the upper tower and prison barracks, which are also portable.\n<br />   This add-on can be considered a massive freebie if you're used to buying the racks yourself. Use at your own discretion.\xa0\n<br />   This is add-on not required for WR compatibility.\n<br />Ash Armor Divine Domina\n<br />File: UL_AshArmor_DivineDomina.esp\n<br />Requires: Divine Domina part 1 resources\n<br />   This will suit up the female version of Ash-Kosh with Divine Domina armor.\n<br />   Resources for this armor are not included.\n<br />Ash Armor Plangkye\n<br />File: UL_AshArmor_Plangkye.esp\n<br />Requirements: None\n<br />   This will suit up the female version of Ash-Kosh with Plangkye's female daedric cuirass.\n<br />   Resources for this armor are included.\n<br />Bathing Mod 3.0 Compatibility\n<br />File: Stinkers 2.0 to 3.0 Upgrader.esp\n<br />Requires: Stinkers 3.0 - Does not require Uvirith's Legacy\n<br />   This can be used with any mod with built-in Stinkers 2.0 compatibility. It replaces 2.0 resources with 3.0 resources.\n<br />   Because I made this patch to work with any mod, it does not resize the Telvanni bathing crystals after replacing them.\n<br />   When you walk into a bathroom and get a face full of crystal, open the console, click on the crystal, and type \"setscale 0.5\".\n<br />   A separate readme is included for further info.\n<br />*****************************************************************************\n<br />IX. Compatibility:\n<br />*****************************************************************************\n<br />You must run the animation fix if you're using LizTail's Animation Kit.\n<br />This mod is incompatible with Uvirith Inside or any other mod that alters the interior of Tel Uvirith, such as Building Up Uvirith's Grave.\n<br />Use Building up Uvirith's Legacy instead. By Artimis Fowl, it makes BuUG available for UL players.\n<br />It will be fully compatible with any mod that alters only the exteriors of Uvirith's Grave such as Green Uvirith and Town of Uvirith.\n<br />I have barely touched the exterior of Uvirith's Grave or the surrounding areas at all.\n<br />This mod is also fully compatible with Uvirith Underground.\n<br />Tamriel Rebuilt: Fully compatible\n<br />   The included add-on is not necessary, but it adds interactivity between UL and Telvannis.\n<br />Pozzo's RoHT Compatibility: Fully compatible\n<br />   Add-ons are included, but UL is fully compatible with RoHT without it.\n<br />LGNPC Tel Uvirith: Fully compatible, but DON'T USE THE UI VERSION.\n<br />BUUG Compatibility: As stated above, use Atemis Fowl's Building Up Uvirith's Legacy instead. It fully replaces the old BuUG with a new UL compatible one.\n<br />   You can currently find it at Planet Elder Scrolls at http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/View.php?view=Mods.Detail&amp;id=7736\n<br />   Only a few things have been removed from BuUG, which were redundant anyway because UL also serves the same purposes in the inner tower.\n<br />   All in all, there is so much more to gain by running both than you will lose by not running BuUg stand-alone.\n<br />   The BuUg prison has been removed, but is served with the Uvirith Vault prison, which is far more expansive in scope and functionality.\n<br />   The alchemy lab has been moved, but UL has a similar alchemy sorter in the secret lab in the upper tower.\n<br />   The tinkerer's lab has been moved elsewhere so that the player may still access it.\n<br />   Most everything else is still fully functional as UL does not touch the Uvirith's Grave exteriors.\n<br />   BuUL does not include Uvirith's Legacy. It is meant to be compatible with UL, not replace it.\n<br />Vorwoda's Shock Centurion: Fully compatible - http://lovkullen.net/Emma/vorwoda.htm\n<br />   A sorter book for the Shock Centurion Manual has also been included in the main file, and has even had its book cover upgraded.\n<br />   UL is also compatible with other Shock Centurion mods.\n<br />Antares' BigMod 7.3: Is now fully compatible. As of version 3.2, you can send your apprentice to find ingredients so long as he's not travelling with you.\n<br />NoM 3.0: Fully compatible. UL includes several NoM resources. Main Upper Tower bed does not allow you to reconfigure your schedules, but does make you rested using NoM's sleep variables. NoM must be loaded after UL.\n<br />The Bathing Mod: Bathing Mod 2.0 compatible objects have been added to all bathing areas of the tower.\n<br />   A patch is required to replace these with Bathing Mod 3.0 objects. See add-ons section for more details.\n<br />Vampiric Embrace: The apprentice is fully VE compatible, and can be turned into a vampire child using VE's scripting.\n<br />   Extra dialogue and behaviors have been added to the tower staff should you decide to turn them into vampires.\n<br />The Lighting Mod: Requires the added .esp to be fully compatible.\n<br />   Not required, but the new cells added by UL will be far too bright without the extra add-on loaded.\n<br />NPC Functionality: have not found any compatibility issues with this mod.\n<br />Unique Finery (and other replacers for Aryon's gloves): If you prefer the look of Aryon's Dominator/Helper from other mods, load them after UL.\n<br />House of Mannequins: The wall partition in St. Delyns with the House of Mannequins banner will not be removed.\n<br />Illuminated Order/Lichcraft: now includes some dialogue, particularly among the undead UL characters, if you're a lich.\n<br />Books of Vvardenfell: BoV 2.3 has the book Bloatspore Cultivation included. However, UL will disable the book available from Jobasha if the Zhariphel Mine quest is not complete.\n<br />   Don't worry, you'll get another copy for free once you complete the quest.\n<br />Tea Mod: Make sure you load the Tea Mod after UL to get full functionality on all the teapots. Many Tea Mod resources have been included in UL.\n<br />Get Fezzed: Some UL NPCs have unique dialogue when you fez them.\n<br />*****************************************************************************\n<br />X. Credits:\n<br />*****************************************************************************\n<br />Are now in their own file because there are so many people to thank for helping me complete this mod. Also, having a separate credits.txt should hopefully make it easier for other modders to find resources I've used in UL for their own mods.\n<br />For current links to all resources used in UL, visit http://www.roadhunter.com/~stuporstar/Uvirith%27sLegacy_credits.html"
