It also fixes a lot of broken textures and makes textures that were supposed to be seamless actually seamless. This module is highly recommended if you plan on using vanilla textures.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Lake Fjalding Anti-Suck:[/b]\n<br />This esp-based optional file drastically increases performance around Lake Fjalding by replacing several of the smaller meshes with larger, merged ones. This has no impact on visuals. This module will not work with mods that change Lake Fjalding and is already included in Tomb of the Snow Prince.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Weapon Sheathing Patch:\n<br />[/b]This module is a compatibility patch between MOP and Weapon Sheathing. This will make weapon sheaths show the fixed MOP weapon meshes instead of the vanilla ones. Make sure to install this after both Weapon Sheathing and MOP.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Chuzei Fix:\n<br />[/b]Enable this if you are not using Better Bodies to fix neck problems with the Native Chuzei Bonemold Helm.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Graphic Herbalism Patch:[/b]\n<br />This is a patch for the modern GH version, compatible with both MWSE and OpenMW. Use this patch after Graphic Herbalism.\n<br />\n<br />============\n<br />Permissions\n<br />============\n<br />\n<br />Feel free to use this mod or any of its assets in your own mods as long as you credit the contributors.\n<br />\n<br />=============\n<br />Installation\n<br />=============\n<br />\n<br />[u][b]Wrye Mash and MO2:[/b][/u]\n<br />\n<br />This mod is packaged as a BAIN archive for ease of use with mod managers. Each module can be installed seperately from within your mod manager of choice, preferably Wrye Mash or Mod Organizer 2.\n<br />\n<br />[u][b]Manual Installation:[/b][/u]\n<br />\n<br />Drop the contents of the individual modules you want to use in your data files folder. Manual installation is not recommended.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Important!\n<br />\n<br />This will overwrite meshes you already have installed. Install mods like Vurt's Trees after MOP.\n<br />\n<br />[/b]You absolutely should regenerate Distant Land if you use MGE (XE).\n<br />========\n<br />Removal\n<br />========\n<br />Uninstall with your mod manager or delete the files that come with this mod.\n<br />\n<br />========\n<br />Recommendations\n<br />========\n<br />[b][u][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45096]Patch for Purists[/url]:\n<br /> [/u][/b]An excellent unofficial patch for the game maintained by Half11. Install this patch before anything else on this list.\n<br />\n<br />[u][b][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45399]Project Atlas:[/url][/b][/u]\n<br />It is recommended that you use MOP together with Project Atlas. Make sure to install Project Atlas after MOP.\n<br />\n<br />========\xa0 \n<br />Contributors\xa0 \n<br />========\xa0 \n<br />Axeljk\n<br />Draconik\n<br />Greatness7\n<br />Half11\n<br />Hemaris\n<br />Lamb Shark\n<br />Melchior Dahrk\n<br />Nich\n<br />Remiros\n<br />Revenorror\n<br />\n<br />Thanks to these contributors for Weapon Sheathing:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]akortunov\n<br />[*]Greatness7\n<br />[*]Heinrich\n<br />[*]Hrnchamd\n<br />[*]London Rook\n<br />[*]Lord Berandas\n<br />[*]Melchior Dahrk\n<br />[*]MementoMoritius\n<br />[*]NullCascade\n<br />[*]PetetheGoat\n<br />[*]PikachunoTM\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />Changelog\n<br />========\n<br />\n<br />1.17.0:\n<br />-Various fixes for vanilla models\n<br />-More fixes for vanilla textures (like the visible UV grid on the guar legs and the misspelled Falasmaryon Propylon)\n<br />-Fixed the faulty collisions of the mist meshes\n<br />-Fixed the faulty collisions of the Vivec cantons\n<br />\n<br />1.16.0b:\n<br />-Hotfix for the missing Hlaalu texture that resulted from an atlas mesh sneaking in\n<br />\n<br />1.16.0:\n<br />-Fixes and improvements for the Stronghold tileset\n<br />-Fixes and improvements for several pieces of the Dwemer tileset as well as Dwemer clutter\n<br />-Fixes for the Daedric tileset (no more mismatched corner textures)\n<br />-Fixes for the Hlaalu tileset, including fixed collisions for the stairway (no more getting stuck)\n<br />-Fixes for several faulty meshes of previous MOP versions including lichen, Vivec cantons, dungeon mist and rugs\n<br />-Performance improvements and UV fixes for several clutter items as well as other miscellaneous items\n<br />-Added Graphic Herbalism patch\n<br />\n<br />1.15.0:\n<br />-CorrectUV Rocks by Nich has been partially incorporated with several additional fixes to the meshes and is no longer required\n<br />-Additional UV fixes for Armors, Clothing, Dwemer tileset pieces, Imperial Tileset pieces and Old Mournhold tileset pieces\n<br />-Additional collision fixes for rocks, frescoes and Old Mournhold pillars\n<br />-Version reformatting\n<br />\n<br />1.14.0:\n<br />-Added backfaces to several meshes that didn't have them\n<br />-More consistent mesh properties\n<br />-Several UV and collision fixes for a wide variety of meshes\n<br />-Bounding box and light fixes for many meshes\n<br />-Fixed several issues left from earlier versions\n<br />-Reworked and improved the Better Vanilla Textures module\n<br />\n<br />1.13.0:\n<br />-Complex LODs for many models including all trees, many rocks, flora and some architecture pieces like the Telvanni tileset\n<br />-Handmade custom vertex normals for all vanilla trees and many flora assets\n<br />-Significantly improved performance, particularly for OpenMW users\n<br />-Many fixes for vanilla models, especially the Sixth House set\n<br />-Fixed Vanilla Textures is now Better Vanilla Textures and covers a wider range of textures\n<br />\n<br />1.12.0:\n<br />-Extensive fixes for weapons, armors and ground meshes\n<br />-Several minor and major fixes for clutter and architecture\n<br />-Fixed several editor markers\n<br />-Additional meshes that have not been covered by previous versions\n<br />-Removed MGE XE Addon, since it is no longer needed\n<br />\n<br />1.11.0:\n<br />-Another very major update containing hundreds of additional fixes and improvements\n<br />-Bug fixes for some meshes frome previous versions\n<br />\n<br />1.10.0:\n<br />-Very major update including hundreds of additional visual and performance fixes for various meshes\n<br />-Various fixes for the Common, Nordic, Telvanni, Velothi, Dwemer and Daedric tilesets\n<br />-Fixes for most miscellaneous items\n<br />\n<br />1.9.1b:\n<br />-Fixed wrong Velothi tileset pieces\n<br />-Fixed broken normals on some Velothi pieces\n<br />\n<br />1.9.1:\n<br />-Fixed dunmer tapestries mistakenly having collisions\n<br />-Applied the fixes to the stronghold set to the ruined variant as well\n<br />-Fixed the UVs of the dunmer ruins\n<br />-More fixes to vanilla armors\n<br />\n<br />1.9.0b:\n<br />-Fixes stronghold walls with wrong orientation\n<br />\n<br />1.9.0:\n<br />-The most massive update by far, including hundreds of extra meshes and significantly improving upon existing ones\n<br />-The majority of the interior Velothi set has been fixed and now includes better UVs\n<br />-The majority of the exterior and partially the interior Telvanni set have been fixed and now include improved meshes with better UVs and collisions\n<br />-A huge amount of other furniture and static meshes, as well as weapons and miscellaneous items have been fixed\n<br />-All trees in the game, including expansions, have been fixed and now have better UVs.
