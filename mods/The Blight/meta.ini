All done with the goal of making the blight more impactful and more interesting.[/size][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b]Features:[/b][size=2]\n<br />- Blight diseases now apply custom visuals to those afflicted. The Player, NPCs,\n<br />and flora will have a special blight effect dynamically applied and removed\n<br />as they become infected or cured.\n<br />\n<br />- Disease progression now causes blight diseases to grow in severity if left unchecked.\n<br />Whenever you contract a blight disease, you have between 2-3 days to cure it. If you do\n<br />not, it will progress and you will become more sick. This will continue forever, so\n<br />make sure to carry some cure blight disease potions!\n<br />\n<br />- Active transmission of blight diseases between actors or objects. Talking\n<br />to infected characters or gathering infected herbs can result in transmitting the\n<br />diseases between either party. Watch out for those infectious trauma roots...\n<br />\n<br />- Passive transmission of blight diseases within blighted zones. Actors and flora\n<br />located in cells with blight storms, or cells neighboring those, have a chance of\n<br />passively catching blight diseases. This chance decreases based on the distance from\n<br />Red Mountain.\n<br />\n<br />- Face coverage is taken into account when transmitting blight diseases. Actors with\n<br />face shielding will have a lower chance of contracting a blight disease than those\n<br />without. Wear a mask! The more coverage, the better protected you will be.\n<br />\n<br />- NPCs will now have and wear the face protection during ash and blight storms to\n<br />protect themselves. To get face protection, the NPC must be within the infection\n<br />range of Red Mountain. Wealthier NPCs have a higher chance of getting face protection.\n<br />NPCs will equip their face protection during storms and remove them afterwards.\n<br />\n<br />- Services are now restricted during Blight storms. Why would someone take you on a\n<br />Silt Strider journey during a horrid Blight storm?
