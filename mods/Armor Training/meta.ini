nexusDescription="[b]This is a MWSE mod and it won't work with OpenMW.\n<br />\n<br />[/b]Leveling armor is often an annoying procedure of getting hit.\n<br />\n<br />But more realistic way of learning how to wear armor would start with getting accustomed to it.\n<br />\n<br />How do you do that? By trying to move around in that metal junk.\n<br />\n<br />... crazy, right?\n<br />\n<br />Armor Training allows such thing. If you are wearing armor you have low skill in, you slowly improve your skill. Wearing Boots, Greaves and Cuirass is the most important part. Just by wearing metal boots you can start working on your Heavy armor. Run around with it long enough and you'll be able to take a hit.\n<br />\n<br />There are several caveats:\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]This is only efficient at low armor skill (by default: &lt;25). After that, you'll get less and less exp, until you don't get any exp whatsoever (by default: at 50 skill).\n<br />[*]It works for walking, running and swimming, but swimming is the most efficient and walking is the least efficient. But it still contributes.\n<br />[*]Speed plays a minor role (configurable). You get slightly more experience the more speed you have.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Everything is configurable. It's hard to gauge the correct leveling speed for something like this, so values are highly tweakable. Based on feedback and my own experience, I can change it later.\n<br />[left][b]\n<br />[size=4]How it works (math):\n<br />[/size][/b][/left][Spoiler]Every second, you gain experience for each armor school equal to:\n<br />\n<br />Before softcap value of a skill:\n<br />XP Gain = armor_worn / 40 * leveling speed / 50 * movement_coef\n<br />\n<br />After softcap value of a skill:\n<br />XP Gain = armor_worn / 40 * leveling speed / 50 * movement_coef * softcap_coef\n<br />\n<br />No experience gain after hardcap value of a skill.\n<br />\n<br />Where:\n<br />\n<br />armor_worn is the fraction of armor worn (e.g. Cuirass contributes 0.25)\n<br />\n<br />leveling speed can be tweaked directly (default: 50)\n<br />\n<br />movement_coef = (movement type multiplier/100) * (speed/50) ^ (exponential factor for speed / 100)\xa0\n<br />\n<br />movement type multiplier can vary for walking, running, and swimming (configurable)\n<br />\n<br />exponential factor for speed can be tweaked directly (default: 20)\n<br />\n<br />softcap_coef = ((hard cap - skill value) / (hard cap - soft cap)) ^ (exponential factor for soft cap / 100)\n<br />\n<br />exponential factor for soft cap can be tweaked (default: 100)\n<br />[/Spoiler]\n<br />[b][size=5][left]\n<br />Installation and Compatibility\n<br />[/left]\n<br />[/size][/b]It's a simple lua mod, install with whatever manager you like. Update MWSE just in case.\n<br />\n<br />Should be compatible with everything, including mods that alter leveling speed. Works well with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48251]Nimble Armor[/url]\xfeff.\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=5]Credits\n<br />[/size][/b]\n<br />[left]\xfeff\x43redits to\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48251]Nimble Armor[/url]\xfeff mod, I am using it's function for the armor parts detection.[/left]"
