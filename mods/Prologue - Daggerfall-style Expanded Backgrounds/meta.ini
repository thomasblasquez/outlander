These new options are inspired by Daggerfall's backgrounds and D&amp;D's additional character info\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Choose a best skill from your Major Skills to gain +5 and choose a mentor who taught you. Supports all classes, including modded and custom.\n<br />[*]Define which province you are from independent of your race, which will grant you a small disposition bonus to that province's race.\n<br />[*]In the Elder Scrolls, a child always shares the race of their mother. Now you can also set the race of your father, which will grant you a random attribute and skill boost from that race. You'll also get a small disposition increase with your father's race. Supports modded races as well.\n<br />[*]Pick a motivation for your character to help you roleplay their journey in Morrowind.\n<br />[*]Immersive flavor text with your background displayed in your journal.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[size=4]Compatibility\n<br />[/size]Not compatible with OpenMW. You are free to port my work over if you have the skills and time.\n<br />Compatible with MTR's chargen mods, but you may mtrCultures and mtrLineage somewhat redundant, as they tackle the same aspects of your character as this mod.\n<br />\n<br />TODO:\n<br />- Interop to add more background details and perhaps for quests?\n<br />- Remove ChargenScenarios requirement (but really, you should be using it!)\n<br />- Better compatibility with modded races\n<br />- UI improvements"
