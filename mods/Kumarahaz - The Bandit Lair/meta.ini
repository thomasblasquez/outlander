nexusDescription="[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/MIYi9gj.png[/img]\n<br />\xfeff[i]To the northeast of Tel Branora, the caverns of Kumarahaz have become a haven for bandits, Dunmer separatists that desire nothing more than to drive the Empire out of Morrowind. Fortified in their underground stronghold, these bandits have been raiding the trading routes of the Inner Sea, taking captives and plunder. Only now they've caught the attention of the Imperial Legion, and their fate is in your hands.\n<br />\n<br />[/i][size=5][b]Description:[/b][/size][/center][size=3]Kumarahaz - The Bandit Lair is a dungeon overhaul and expansion mod, fully transforming the vanilla game dungeon of Kumarahaz into a perilous and exciting new adventure, with new challenges to face! Dangers abound within, can you defeat the bandits of Kumarahaz? Can you put an end to their terrors upon the seas? And will you aid the Imperial Legion, or simply use them as a shield, a means to lay claim to the treasures of Kumarahaz for yourself?\xa0 Well now, that's up to you, the player, to decide and find out for yourself!\n<br />\n<br />In vanilla Morrowind, Kumarahaz was a small cavern to the north of Tel Branora, home to a handful of measly low-level bandits, a wee bit of loot, and a dungeon delve that could take you anywhere between 5-10 minutes to complete. No quests took you there, no exciting surprises awaited within, just another dull, under detailed, and plain cavern with the occasional bit of furnishings.\n<br />\n<br />But with The Bandit Lair, Kumarahaz is a boring dungeon no longer! For here you'll find caverns lined with fungal growths, underground lakes with island alcoves, and underwater tunnels that hide secret paths in the depths below.\n<br />\n<br />Richly atmospheric and scenic, Kumarahaz is home to many dangers, a bandit encampment, fortified and protected by barriers and archers. A direct assault will be costly, but the clever adventurer can find ways around, paths that allow one to avoid a head-on fight, and instead strike from the shadows.\n<br />\n<br />For those who prefer a companion to join them on their delve or a goal to aim for, an Imperial Legion agent in Tel Branora is looking for help in tracking down a dangerous group of bandits. If you need a place to start, you can find him on the docks. Or simply go straight for the dungeon, the choice is yours.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=5][center]Features:[/center][/size][/b][list]\n<br />[*][size=3]A complete overhaul and expansion of Kumarahaz with three new richly detailed dungeon cell interiors, containing over 5,000 handplaced objects[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]One new quest[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]A number of new flavor text documents, adding a few details to the lives of the bandits of Kumarahaz[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]A potential player home (technically, once the bandits are dead, the caverns are yours for the taking.
