nexusDescription="After trying out several wind and rain sound replacers for Morrowind, I found that none quite captured the atmosphere I was looking for. Many felt too artificial, too repetitive, or just didn\x2019t sit well in the game\x2019s soundscape. So I decided to create my own.\n<br />This mod introduces a custom set of ambient wind and rain sounds, carefully assembled from high-quality recordings sourced from the BBC Sound Effects Library. Each sound has been meticulously edited, EQ\x2019\x64, and layered with subtle reverb to achieve a more natural and immersive audio experience. The result is a more atmospheric, cohesive sound environment that blends seamlessly into Morrowind\x2019s soundscape.\n<br />This isn\x2019t a dramatic overhaul, just a refined, thoughtfully crafted replacement intended to enhance immersion without drawing attention to itself. It\x2019s designed to feel like it\x2019s always belonged in the game."
