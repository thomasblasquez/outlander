Above the wave's upon the horizon sits a Sea Fortress, these act as mini dungeons for plundering, which sit a good swim away. Don't forget to use those ladders!\n<br />\n<br />Acting as mini dungeons, scale these 4 leveled forts and fight the long forgotten that Dwell within! make your way to the top floor, kill the boss, get the key, head down to the basement level and unlock the door to your new found wealth. As an optional objective they'll be a second random key hidden somewhere on either one of the floors to unlock an addition door on the top floor storage room for even more riches..\xa0\n<br />\n<br />Everything is set to respawn. Fallen into the water with no way up? Just use the ladders that's been placed on the docks.\n<br />All four of these fort's don't make any landscape edits so it shouldn't conflict with anything. It's also available for both TR and non TR users.
