(If you take an item while its trapped it will trigger the trap)\n<br />-Change the number of default items displayed\n<br />-Display messageboxes on loot\n<br />-Show loot from containers with scripted OnActivate (if you don't know what this means leave it off.)\n<br />\n<br />The keys are rebindable if you edit the config (in-game menu option coming soon)\n<br />\n<br />Requirements:\n<br />-MGEXE\n<br />-MWSE-lua beta branch (available here: https://nullcascade.com/mwse/mwse-dev.zip )\n<br />-OpenMW is not supported and cannot be supported probably ever, sorry.\n<br />\n<br />Installation:\n<br />-Drag and drop data files folder, merge if asked.\n<br />-If you want to change the default loot keys from Z and X, load the game first,\xa0\n<br />then navigate to: data files&#92;mwse&#92;config&#92;quick loot.json and open in a text editor. Change the config keys to what you wish.\n<br />\n<br />Uninstallation:\n<br />-Remove or rename the main.lua file. There is also a mod configuration option to disable the mod as well.\n<br />\n<br />Coming Soon:\n<br />-Key rebinding with mouse support\n<br />\n<br />Special Thanks:\n<br />Nullcascade - MWSE-lua for which none of this would be possible, and for some fantastic code contributions\n<br />Svengineer- contributed code and many fixes, inspired the quickdisable key\n<br />Greatness7 - MCM code, other fixes\n<br />codering - Buying Game compatibility + script fixes\n<br />PeteTheGoat - Extensive testing and all around big supporter also a good guy\n<br />Hrnchamd - MWSE-lua work, MGEXE, MCP, all of that great stuff\n<br />doublemoulinet - testing\n<br />The Morrowind Modding Community Discord for all of its support"
