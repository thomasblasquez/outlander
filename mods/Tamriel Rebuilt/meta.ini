When Bethesda Softworks, the developers of the Elder Scrolls series, started designing the game towards the end of the 1990s, the original intent was to include all of the eponymous country's landmass in the game. As it turned out, this was too large a task and the scope was reduced to Morrowind's central volcanic island, Vvardenfell. Even so, the result was an enormous, colorful world that many, in our project and beyond, still consider one of their most memorable game experiences.[/font][font=Arial] Our aim is to pick up where Bethesda left off: by creating the rest of its mainland, we are building Morrowind as it could have been, in a way that is truthful to the vision of the original developers. Rather than just providing a game world several times the size of the original, we want that world's vistas, stories and people to be every inch as captivating as its example.\n<br />\n<br />Tamriel Rebuilt is a long-term project. What took a team of paid, full-time developers several years obviously takes a group of volunteers longer. On the other hand we also have the luxury of not being bound by the same temporal and budgetary constraints that a game studio is subject to, which means we are free to undertake some things that would otherwise never become reality.\n<br />\n<br />There is much to be created, much to be expanded and improved upon, and for that we need all the help we can get. If you love Morrowind and its world, if you are interested in the creation of mods or games, or if you just want a creative outlet in a lively online community, consider taking a look at how to [url=https://www.tamriel-rebuilt.org/content/join]join the project[/url].\n<br />[/font]\n<br />[font=Arial][center]We hope you enjoy our creation!\n<br />\n<br />[b] - The Tamriel Rebuilt Team\xfeff\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/4Kr9GGY.png[/img][/center]\n<br />[left][b][img]https://i.imgur.com/3SLESoW.jpg[/img]\xfeff\n<br />\n<br />Q: Is Tamriel Rebuilt still being developed?[/b]\n<br />[b]A:[/b] Absolutely! Even after all these years, the Tamriel Rebuilt community is very active! We mostly communicate through our\xa0[url=https://discordapp.com/invite/9T6TtNU]Discord server[/url], where we discuss current work, propose new ideas, and hold meetings. Our meeting notes are kept\xa0[url=https://www.tamriel-rebuilt.org/online-meetings]here[/url]. That said, we can always use more hands on deck. The best way to start helping the project is to read through this\xa0[url=https://www.tamriel-rebuilt.org/content/join]this page[/url]. Of course, becoming a developer is not the only way to become active in the TR community. Even if you feel you have nothing to contribute to the project, please stop by the Discord and introduce yourself. It is a great way to see what we are up and have your questions answered.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Q: What do all the different ESPs do?[/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][b]TR_Mainland.esm[/b] - finished landmass, including fully playable quests and interiors.\n<br />[*][b]TR_Factions.esp[/b] - integrates faction questlines and progression, contains additional Hortator and Nerevarine quests.\n<br />[*](Separate download) [b]TR_Firemoth_remover.esp[/b] - removes the TR version of Firemoth, so you could load the vanilla version or another[i] [/i]Firemoth overhaul.\n<br />[/list][b]\n<br />Q: Should I still load [i]Siege at Firemoth.esp[/i]?[/b]\n<br />If you are playing TR version 24.12+ and want to have access to TR's overhauled and integrated version of Firemoth, then [b]NO[/b]. Doing so will result in two different versions of Firemoth loading on top of each other, causing all sorts of mayhem. If you [i]don't[/i] want TR's version of Firemoth and prefer to use the vanilla Siege at Firemoth plugin, then you will have to load the optional [b]TR_Firemoth_remover.esp[/b], [i]after[/i] the original Siege at Firemoth.esp. This patch removes TR's take on Firemoth and allows you to run the original version, but also fixes landscape conflicts between the original Firemoth and TR's mainland. If you want to run other Firemoth overhaul mods, then these need a separate patch to remove conflicts with TR's mainland landmass. See more information [url=https://www.tamriel-rebuilt.org/about/frequently-asked-questions/Firemoth]\xbbhere\xab[/url].\n<br />\n<br />[b]Q: Do I still need to register Tamriel_Data BSA files?[/b]\n<br />Not anymore! As of v10.1, Tamriel_Data no longer uses BSA files. It instead packages all assets as loose files inside the downloaded archive. The BSA files included in the archive are dummy files meant to overwrite older versions for people who are updating their Tamriel_Data.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Q: Why am I seeing yellow exclamation marks everywhere?[/b]\n<br />[b]Q: Why am I getting \"actor has no animation class\" errors?[/b]\n<br />[b]Q: Why is my game crashing at character selection?[/b]\n<br />You may not have (correctly) installed the latest version of Tamriel Data. Try (re)installing it; see the instructions [url=https://www.tamriel-rebuilt.org/content/how-install-tamriel-rebuilt]here[/url].\n<br />\n<br />[b]Q: Why is my minimap cut off?[/b]\n<br />[b]A: [/b]The Morrowind minimap has a hardcoded size limit. You will either need to use the [font=Arial] [font=Arial][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/19510/]Morrowind Code Patch[/url][/font][/font], which has an optional \"extended map\" change that doubles the space the minimap can cover, or you need to switch to[font=Arial][font=Arial] [url=http://openmw.org/]OpenMW[/url][/font] [/font], which has no hardcoded minimap limit. If you're using MWSE, we recommend instead using the [font=Arial][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46071]UI Expansion[/url][/font] mod that removes the map limits in a nicer way than the Morrowind Code Patch.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Q: Does Tamriel Rebuilt add quests?[/b]\n<br />[b]A:[/b] Absolutely! TR_Mainland alone adds more than six hundred miscellaneous and faction quests, and the number will only increase with time.\n<br />For more information, please see a detailed response[b]\xa0[/b][url=https://www.tamriel-rebuilt.org/node/3471]here[/url][b].[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b]Q: When is Tamriel Rebuilt going to be complete?[/b]\n<br />[b]A:[/b] Good question! The joke answer is 2090 and the optimistic answer is 2035. However, \"it will be done when it's done\" is unfortunately the only true answer: attention and contributions to Tamriel Rebuilt vary, developers come and go, and plans change. All of these factors make it pretty hard if not impossible to predict when Tamriel Rebuilt will be officially \"complete\".\n<br />\n<br />[b]Q: Will any of the finished content be redone?[/b]\n<br />[b]A:[/b] The first three releases, which roughly encompass Telvannis, the Sacred Lands around Necrom, and the east around Akamora and Bosmora, will be redone in the future. Both landscaping, questlines, and dialogue need an overhaul to put them in line with the new standards we have developed. The first part of this rework, the area around the cities of Firewatch and Helnim, and the island of Althoa, was included in 2022's [i]Embers of Empire[/i]. The next overhaul is in progress, targeting the Sundered Scar region. Other areas will likely wait a while before any major overhauls are undertaken.[b]\n<br />\n<br />Q: Is Tamriel Rebuilt lore friendly?\n<br />Q: Why the hate against Elder Scrolls Online?[/b]\n<br />Opinions vary. For most new players, Tamriel Rebuilt is not considered to be lore friendly anymore, sometimes even aggressively hostile to new lore.\n<br />Generally, we consider Tamriel Rebuilt's game world to be friendly to the lore of TES III, the First Pocket Guide to the Empire, Redguard and Battlespire first and foremost. Later changes and additions to the lore were made when Tamriel Rebuilt had already been in development for years, making it necessary to pick and choose which lore bits we include in our version of Tamriel even when the only new lore was contained in TES IV: Oblivion. With a consistent game world as one of our main goals, a lot of new lore simply doesn't fit. Find out more about our lore policy\xa0[url=https://www.tamriel-rebuilt.org/about/about-our-lore]here[/url].\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[b]Q: Is Tamriel Rebuilt compatible with OpenMW?[/b]\n<br />[b]A:[/b] Yes, the odd bug notwithstanding. OpenMW is as much in development as Tamriel Rebuilt and bugs can and will happen. You can find OpenMW's stance\xa0[url=https://wiki.openmw.org/index.php?title=Overhaul_Mods]here[/url]\xa0\x61nd notes about compatibility\xa0[url=https://wiki.openmw.org/index.php?title=User:Darklocq/Mod_testing_notes#Tamriel_Rebuilt_and_the_Project:_Tamriel_mods]here[/url].\n<br />\n<br />[b]Q: Is Tamriel Rebuilt compatible with Skyrim: Home of the Nords and Project Cyrodiil?[/b]\n<br />[b]A:[/b] Absolutely, starting with our common asset base (Tamriel_Data). All of the province mods which are part of Tamriel Rebuilt and Project Tamriel have the aim to create a seamless, fitting gameworld. There are currently some rough edges (lore and landscape), but they will be smoothed out in time. Our goal is to make it possible to travel across a consistent and interconnected Tamriel. In fact, as of version 24.12, Tamriel Rebuilt even includes a quest directing you from the Morrowind mainland to the Kingdom of Anvil, should you have the latest version of Project Cyrodiil installed.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Q: Is Tamriel Rebuilt compatible with Skywind or Morroblivion?[/b]\n<br />[b]A:[/b] This cannot be answered with either yes or no, because the question itself is wrong. Both Skywind and Morroblivion are mods made for later games in the Elder Scrolls franchise, TES IV: Oblivion and TES V: Skyrim (Special Edition), respectively. To make Tamriel Rebuilt (a TES III: Morrowind mod) \"compatible\" with either would mean porting our content (assets, landscaping, dialogue and quests) to the games these two mods were built upon. This seems out of the question due to time and work constrains and simply because of the vast artistic and technical differences between the different games.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Q: Why is Tamriel Rebuilt incompatible with Morrowind Rebirth?[/b]\n<br />[b]A:[/b]\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/37795/?]Morrowind Rebirth [/url]is said to be incompatible with Tamriel Rebuilt due to some overlapping landscaping edits, edits to the same NPCs on Vvardenfell due to TR_Travels, balance changes which make Tamriel Rebuilt content overpowered, and model replacements included in Morrowind Rebirth that make Firewatch in particular unnavigable. Neither of these are game-breaking and we do not currently consider Morrowind Rebirth incompatible. Trancemaster's recommendation to not use Tamriel Rebuilt and Morrowind Rebirth together is just that: a recommendation. Both mods can run in tandem, but not without the stated problems. Fortunately, such a patch is available [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47361]here[/url].\n<br />\n<br />[b]Q: I found a bug!

Our sister project, Project Tamriel (PT), is working on the provinces of Skyrim and Cyrodiil in their own unique vision:\n<br />\n<br />[b]Skyrim: Home of the Nords (S:HotN):[/b] [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44921/]https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44921/[/url]\n<br />[b]Project Cyrodiil (PC):[/b] [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44922/]https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44922/\n<br />[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b][img]https://i.imgur.com/DD3v09s.png[/img]\n<br />[/b][/size]\n<br />As a high-impact mod, TR does not work well with several other mods. On the other hand, there are certain mods that will enrich both the vanilla and TR experience.\n<br />\n<br />For a list of recommended mods, see [url=https://www.tamriel-rebuilt.org/recommended-mods]https://www.tamriel-rebuilt.org/recommended-mods[/url]\xfeff\n<br />For a list of incompatible mods or mods that need a patch to work, see [b]an incomplete WIP list[/b]: [url=https://www.tamriel-rebuilt.org/incompatible-mods]https://www.tamriel-rebuilt.org/incompatible-mods[/url]"
