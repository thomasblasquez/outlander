Once your Bound Longbow spell finishes, all Bound Arrows in your inventory are removed. Bound Arrows have no weight or value, and use the same model as the Daedric Arrow.\n<br />\n<br />In the [b]Unbalanced[/b] version, Bound Arrows deal 1-4 damage, same as Steel Arrows, which are mid-tier. Bound Arrows are summoned along with your Bound Longbow regardless of your ranking in Conjuration.[/quote]Replaces original esp, only requires Morrowind+Tribunal+Bloodmoon. Works on vanilla and OpenMW.\n<br />\n<br />[b]If this mod doesn't work on vanilla engine immediately do the following (you need to do it only once):[/b]\n<br />\n<br />1.\xa0[/size]Cast your Bound Longbow spell and save the game.\n<br />2.\xa0Load the game you just saved (be sure your spell is still active).\n<br />[size=2]\n<br />Works as intended on OpenMW. I've been playing with this fixed \"unbalanced version\" for a long time, it's very fun if your character is a conjurer. For example, I was only using bound weapons in my playthrough.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/55075]Stupid-Metal Hitmarker-Mod --- OpenMW[/url]\xa0 - I could also recommend this.\n<br />[color=#8e7cc3]__________________________________________[/color]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />More patches can be found here, I recommend checking out these pages to see if you need anything else for your modlist:\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47224]Luce's Misc Mods and Patches[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48955]alvazir's various patches[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51194]Various BCoM and OpenMW patches[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49232]Sigourn's Misc Mods and Patches[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43795]Various tweaks and fixes[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48683]RandomPal's random mods and patches[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/55897]Null's Minor Patches[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/55378]Boats OpenMW patch[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/55719]patches for BCOM and other mods[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51813]V.I.P. - Vegetto's Important Patches[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/56220]Nibby's fixes[/url]\n<br />[url=https://modding-openmw.com/mods/momw-patches/]Modding OpenMW patches[/url] - in this collection you can find many useful fixes (even if you play on vanilla engine, but in this case don't choose OpenMW specific patches in the installer).\n<br />\n<br />[b]Credits and thanks:[/b]\n<br />RandomPal for BCOM compatible Julan patch\n<br />Leyawynn for\xa0\x41shlander Dombrists, Markond for finding out the issue with sound volume.\n<br />micheru12 for finding more compativility issues between Julan and TOTSP\n<br />Istreddify for Ald Gash lighthouse\n<br />Endoran for Master Index Redux\n<br />Orestes_the_nwah for\xa0Luminous Lanes of the West Gash\xa0\n<br />Ortiee for Faction Living Quarters\n<br />GVLT for Web of Mephala\n<br />TheEgman\xfeff for Bound Arrow For Bound Longbow mod\n<br />\n<br />All the mod and patch authors for their wonderful creations[/size]"
