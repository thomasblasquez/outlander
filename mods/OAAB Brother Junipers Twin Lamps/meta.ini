It allowed you to join the elusive group of abolitionists you meet in the vanilla game, hear their stories and the stories of those they help, and to lead them to victory against slavery on Vvardenfell. The storyline was compelling and nuanced, bittersweet, multi-branching, and full of real choices that can change the outcome for some of the NPCs you get to know.\n<br />\n<br />I loved it.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />This is my tribute to that mod, an update that makes use of recently released modder's resources to bring the mod's locations to life, fixes bugs, and adds some extra dialogue and quest choices. But at it's core, it's still the mod Brother Juniper made.\n<br />\n<br />Brother Juniper, if you're reading this - thank you. I hope you like the changes I've made.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][b][size=5]Features[/size]\n<br />[/b][/center][list]\n<br />[*]Many new locations to visit, including a Camonna Tong smuggling camp, an inn offering shelter to strangers, a shipwreck, and a besieged shack in the Bitter Coast.\xa0\n<br />[*][New in 2.0] These locations have been updated with OAAB assets, including an overhaul of the shipwreck by Corsair, the author of [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51364]OAAB Shipwrecks[/url]\xfeff. Locations which previously mixed tilesets or made extensive use of kitbashing have been made more coherent.\n<br />[*]NPCs to love and loathe - slavers, abolitionists, slaves, and a lot of people whose lives are impacted by the slavery question. From noble-born politicians to humble farmers and miners, you'll meet them all.\n<br />[*]900 new lines of dialogue added by Brother Juniper\n<br />[*]Twin Lamps faction is now joinable.\n<br />[*]~ 20 new quests with branching paths and different potential outcomes\n<br />[*]7-8 vanilla quests have additional commentary, options, or integration with the mod in some fashion.\n<br />[*][New in 2.0] Bugs and typos fixed, dialogue and quest options tweaked, and supporting dialogue added where appropriate. Quests should flow more smoothly now.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[center][size=5][b]Starting the mod[/b][/size][/center]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]You'll need to learn the Twin Lamps password. You can do that by freeing slaves, or by stumbling upon one of the central characters (see the walkthrough included for more details).\n<br />[*]Once you know the password, speak to the new leader of the Twin Lamps to join (again, see walkthrough for details).\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[center][b][size=5]Requirements[/size][/b][/center]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49042]OAAB Data[/url]\xfeff\n<br />[*]Morrowind, Tribunal, and Bloodmoon\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[center][size=5][b]Compatibility[/b][/size][/center]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Compatible with both MWSE and OpenMW\n<br />[*]Compatible with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46772]Dura gra-Bol and the Grab-All Gang[/url]\xfeff\n<br />[*]Should be mostly compatible with (most) mods that add options for freeing slaves (eg Slave Escort, Live Free, Free the Slaves) - although there is a slight incompatibility with regard to the Arvel's backstory with Cyran0's Slave Escort mod.

Courtesy of Militades.\n<br />-Added transportation option to Camonna Tong camp.\n<br />-Enabled slaves in Camonna Tong camp to be freed.\n<br />-Added NPC companion for Dren Plantation quest.\n<br />-Added dialogue reactions for Mournhold.\n<br />-Added a slave Merchant to Mournhold.\n<br />-Several bug-fixes (PLEASE e-mail me if you find any others!)\n<br />*****************************************************************\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \xa0\x31. INSTALLING THE PLUGIN\n<br />*****************************************************************\n<br />To install the plugin, unzip the files into the Morrowind/Data Files\n<br />directory.\xa0\n<br />*****************************************************************\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \xa0\x32. PLAYING THE PLUGIN\n<br />*****************************************************************\n<br />From the Morrowind Launcher, select Data Files and check the box\xa0\n<br />next to the Juniper's Twin Lamps.esp file.\n<br />If you have acquired the \"Twin Lamps\" topic, you can start this thread\xa0\n<br />by talking to Jarodan at Stendarr's Retreat Inn.\xa0 Another path is\xa0\n<br />by stumbling across the shack along the coast south of Hla Olad.\n<br />You'll need to free about 15 slaves before you can actually join the\xa0\n<br />Twin Lamps and get quests from Tiras Bitterblade.\n<br />KNOWN ISSUES: Due to the removal of three guard references, you may\xa0\n<br />receive the message \"Cannot find 'TL_Mineguard1'\" when loaded with\n<br />certain plugins that modify those guards. While there don't appear\n<br />to be any effects from this message, you can remove it in 90%+ of\xa0\n<br />the cases by opening up this plug-in in the construction set and\n<br />re-saving it (so the date is *later* than the conflicting plug-in.)\n<br />*****************************************************************\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \xa0\x33. COMMENTS\n<br />*****************************************************************\n<br />I owe a tremendous debt to Militades, who did amazing work. I think\xa0\n<br />the voices just lift the whole plugin to another level.\n<br />A primary goal of mine has been to seamlessly weave the Twin Lamps\n<br />faction into Morrowind, so that it's entirely consistant with the\xa0\n<br />original game and the world of Tamriel.\n<br />I've also tried to make if fun to play, with an interesting story,\xa0\n<br />interesting characters, and some depth.\n<br />Finally, there are many historical references to the abolitionist\n<br />movement in the United States. For example, the text in \"A Slave's\n<br />Life\" is taken from \"Uncle Tom's Cabin,\" a book that had a great\n<br />impact on the way people thought about slavery.\xa0 Many of the\xa0\n<br />quests, including the strategy debate, reflect real-life steps\xa0\n<br />that social movements such as abolitionism have taken.\n<br />*****************************************************************\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \xa0\x34. LIST OF CHANGES\n<br />*****************************************************************\n<br />This is difficult to write for a mod this large, and I've tried\n<br />hard to make this mod as clean as possible, used TESAME, etc.\xa0 But\xa0\n<br />I think this is important, so...\n<br />The most invasive changes were to the following quests: In the Redoran\n<br />quest to disrupt the Caldera mine, keys sitting out in the open were\n<br />removed, and several generic Hlaalu guards were removed.\xa0 New keys were\xa0\n<br />given to NPCs.\xa0 Likewise, in the Telvanni slave rebellion quest, the\xa0\n<br />key in the mine was removed.\xa0 New keys were added to several guards.\n<br />No game settings were changed.\xa0 No static objects, books,\xa0\n<br />weapons, armor, etc. were changed.\xa0 Where objects were added, they\xa0\n<br />begin with tl_, except some books and keys (usually bk_tl_...)\n<br />There are hundreds of lines of dialogue added.\xa0 Nothing was removed,\xa0\n<br />nor was anything added not directly related to the Twin Lamps faction.\n<br />Several generic \"latest rumors\" responses were added.\n<br />In the TRIBUNAL journal settings, I added \"close out\" flags to a couple\n<br />faction quests (Redoran - Caldera Disrupt, Telvanni - Slave Rebellion) you\xa0\n<br />may activate without being part of that faction. [So if you do the quests\xa0\n<br />before joining a Great House, it may not show up on your quest list the\xa0\n<br />second time through.]\n<br />The Twin Lamps Faction settings were changed.\n<br />BitterCoast Region cell -11, 4 was changed to \"Fatleg's Camp,\" and\n<br />a bandit camp was added there.\xa0 Lots of NPCs, several scripts.\n<br />A shack and NPCs were added on the southern edge of the Bitter Coast\n<br />swamps, near Hla Olad.\n<br />An inn was added just northeast of Vivec, with assorted clutter and NPCs in the\n<br />vicinity, extending out to the bridge.\xa0 Global variables were added to make\xa0\n<br />the rental bed work, but are not implemented.\n<br />A ship, NPCs, and associated clutter were added on the coast East of Vivec\n<br />and south of Omani Manor.\xa0 Several scripts.\n<br />An NPC and skiff was added to Hla Olad.\n<br />A table and two NPCs were added to Suran.\xa0 The pathgrid was changed to\xa0\n<br />adjust for the table.\n<br />A new NPC was added at Balur salvu's farm, south of Pelagiad.\n<br />New NPCs were added at Sterdecan's farm, west of Suran.\n<br />A new NPC was added in Balmora, with script.\n<br />A new NPC and a couple creatures, with scripts, were added in Ald'ruhn.\n<br />A new ship, clutter, and NPCs were added to Tel Aruhn.\xa0 Several NPCs were\n<br />added on an island just east of Tel Aruhn.\xa0 Most have scripts.\n<br />A couple new guards were added in Sadrith Mora, with scripts.\n<br />Minor clutter (a note) added to Irgola's shop, and the slave markets in\xa0\n<br />Molag Mar and Suran, with scripts.\n<br />Clutter was added to the Abebaal mine, and the lighting/fog settings were\n<br />changed.\xa0 Eleedal lei's script was changed.\xa0 Inventory and scripts for the\xa0\n<br />other slaves were changed.\xa0 A key in the mine was removed, and new keys\n<br />were added to several guards.\n<br />A script was added and abilites were changed to an NPC inside the St. Olm's\xa0\n<br />miners and tanners hall.\n<br />A building was added and removed in the Telvanni Underworks, in the wilderness\xa0\n<br />east of Gnisis along the mountains, north of Suran along the river, and\xa0\n<br />south of Fatleg's Camp (cell -11,2).\xa0 Nothing in-game, but will show up in the\n<br />editor.\n<br />Three NPCs were added to the Mournhold Market.\n<br />New NPCs were added to the Caldera mines.\xa0 The guards were changed/removed (no\xa0\n<br />longer generic guards, now unique Caldera mine guards), and the pathgrid was\xa0\n<br />changed so NPCs wouldn't get stuck on a certain beam.\xa0 A door on one of\n<br />the slaveshacks was locked.\xa0 Keys sitting out in the open were removed, and\n<br />new keys were added to NPCs.\xa0 Stats on several miners were changed.\n<br />I may have left out one or two minor things, but that's essentially it.\n<br />[/code]"
