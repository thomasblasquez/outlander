I have only one question for you: Who Will You Reincarnate As?\"[/color][/i]\n<br />[/b]\n<br />[b]Reincarnate [/b]is designed around a [b]Vanilla Plus [/b]perspective. The power level of the races is slightly higher than the best of the vanilla races. This was done by giving them all meaningful passives that are useful in a wide variety of situations throughout the game. The weaker races have been buffed significantly so that they are awesome and competitive. All races now have a daily power that is both powerful and versatile. Your choice of race is not only meaningful, but difficult, since they are all so good!\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][b]Attributes [/b]are 100% vanilla. They can be viewed in the screenshots, as well as on [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Races]this UESP page[/url]. \n<br />[*][b]Skills [/b]are mostly vanilla with minor changes. All races received a net increase of +5 skill total. Both vanilla and modded skill bonuses are listed below with the modded changes indicated [color=#b6b6b6][i](like this)[/i].[/color]\n<br />[*][b]Passives [/b]are vanilla plus. Most of the original bonuses are remaining, with additional passives on top of them so that all races have multiple constant effects they benefit from.\n<br />[*][b]Toggles [/b]are passives that can be disabled and re-enabled at will with a free spell. The game will remember if you had a toggle on or off.\n<br />[*][b]Powers [/b]have been overhauled, and are now powerful buffs with a multitude of viable use cases. They are balanced relative to each other, and intended to be used along side the Morrowind Code Patch change that allows NPCs to use racial powers. As such, some of the overtuned powers were redesigned with NPC usage in mind. Morrowind Code Patch is not required, only recommended.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />Reincarnate is designed to pair well with its companion mod

/>[color=#ffe599][size=3]Altmer[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />They are a magical glass cannon. Changing that about them would go against who they are. Vanilla Altmer is already so good that all that was needed was a power that furthered the central theme. The power is loosely based on the description of their mystic blood from Shadowkey. My headcanon is that they peer into the divine realm, resulting in this sort of forbidden knowledge effect where their minds are expanded to let the magicka flow through them, but it's so overwhelming as to be painful. I also adjusted the erroneous 50% weakness to fire to be in line with the rest of the weaknesses, just like every other race mod does. No need to reinvent the wheel for some of these changes. \n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#a4c2f4][size=3]Argonian[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />Their descriptions all say they are good with spears, and so the skill changes reflect that. Giving them permanent (togglable) water buffs was a no-brainer, but why specifically 150 swift swim? Because now you actually swim 25% faster than you run. Water used to be IN the way, now water IS the way. Chameleon reflects their ability to blend into swampy environments, which Morrowind certainly is in many parts. Gameplay-wise, it facilitates stealthier builds, which Argonians are also known to be good at. The power is themed after the hist, more specifically hist-magic. As if you are infusing magical spit with the hist, which is corrosive to those who are not born of it, and regenerative to you. It's worth noting that chameleon and blind stack, making you quite difficult to detect!\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#b6d7a8][size=3]Bosmer[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />Y'ffre is the central god to the Bosmer pantheon, and is a magical deity related to their green pact. No way I'm introducing cannibalism, but some magical inclination is nice, which has the added benefit of thematically tying all the elven races together through their shared magicka boost. Sanctuary represents their nimbleness and spontaneity that makes then difficult to pin down. Beast Tongue is kind of like the idea of Animal Companion, and I really like when games let you buff up your companion. I am super excited about this change, because your new buddy will absolutely flex on all the other wild beasts. Especially creative players will realize that the power doesn't necessarily have to target a creature...\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#d5a6bd][size=3]Breton[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />Thematically, Bretons were already perfect. All my changes are for gameplay reasons. Resist paralysis is basically a bug fix since resist magicka doesn't work for it, and Bretons are supposed to be resistant to status effects. Dragonskin was reinvented as an anti-spell shield, furthering the theme of Bretons being mage tanks. Dragons in Skyrim are immune to paralysis, so I thought it would be a cool reference for Dragonskin to grant full immunity to it.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#999999][size=3]Dunmer[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />Dunmer are versatile fighters, being talented with blades, bows, and magic. The Great Houses are renowned for their signature Bonemold armor. Skill changes reflect both of these facts. They live their whole lives near Red Mountain and don't somehow resist the ash and blight storms? Well they do now. Dunmer are well known for their incredible magical talents (see House Telvanni). Morrowind is arguably more magical than High Rock, so I feel they absolutely deserve a magicka buff on par with the Bretons. Dunmer culture reveres their ancestors and calls upon them for help in times of battle. Given that the ability is already called Ancestor Guardian, it felt like slipping on a perfectly fitting glove to let them summon an ancestral ghost.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#d9d2e9][size=3]Imperial[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />Famous for their legion who are always using heavy armor and shields, not light armor and fisticuffs, hence the skill changes. By far the most versatile and well traveled race, the cosmopolitan passive reflects that in both flavor and bonuses. Alessia is the founder of the first empire, and ever since Akatosh did her a solid, it seems like all of Tamrielic history has Imperials on top. Luck is definitely on their side. Voice of the Emperor was buffed to be more versatile. It can now be used in combat, as well as on more than one person thanks to the personality buff. \n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#f9cb9c][size=3]Khajiit[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />Perhaps not the strongest, but easily the most [i]FUN [/i]changes. The Cathay-raht species of Khajiit are famous for their reflexes and acrobatics, and so I leaned into that. Some players might not want permanent night eye or slow fall, so you are free to toggle them on and off. Elsweyr is the home of many styles of claw-dances, which are basically Khajiiti martial arts. This power is based on the style of the whispering claw. And we don't need to talk about the fact that they stole a third passive. Isn't that, like, against the rules or something?! And why a mercantile buff? Maybe they're good barterers from a lifestyle as traveling merchants. Maybe they're stealing your coins mid-transaction. Nirn will never know.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#d0e0e3][size=3]Nord[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />Already an amazing race, not much was needed to be done. Nordic armor is light, not medium, so I changed their skills so that they actually specialize in their own armor. I gave them bonus attack to tilt them towards the direction of melee damage dealer. Thunderchild is a reference to the Thu'um, and is mechanically the combination of Thunder Fist and Woad, tuned to fit the storm aesthetic. Sound really helps sell that it's akin to a Shout. A cool thing about sound is that casters will still attempt to cast spells even if their chances are dirt low. Glory to Kyne!\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#93c47d][size=3]Orc[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />Another amazing race. They are renowned for being the best smiths in Tamriel, I think that deserves a +15. To contrast the Nord, I made the Orcs the melee tank, and redesigned their passives and Berserk to reflect this. Berserk makes you feel like the Juggernaut. Early game, you'll be resisting everything that hits you. Late game, you'll be able to overcome the agility penalty to enable tanking hits without going down. \n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#fce5cd][size=3]Redguard[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />I'm sensing a pattern in already good martial races. To complete the trifecta of martial themes, Redguards were leaned into a melee mobility role, with nearly endless amounts of fatigue, reflecting their incredible stamina portrayed in lore. I was skeptical to give them constant fatigue regeneration, but 1/sec feels just right. Why no endurance buff? Because it's impossible to balance. If you're running a mostly vanilla setup, then temporary endurance is nothing more than a small fortify fatigue. But if you are using a mod that updates health in real time based on strength and endurance, then it's an incredibly overpowered fortify health effect.\n<br />\n<br />[b]____________________________________________________________________________\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]Requirements[/size]\n<br />[/b][list]\n<br />[*]Morrowind\n<br />[/list][b]\n<br />[size=3]Installation[/size][/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Extract files into .../Morrowind/Data Files, and enable Reincarnate - Races of Morrowind.esp\n<br />[*]Or use your preferred mod manager!\n<br />[/list][b]\n<br />[size=3]New Game Required[/size]\n<br />[/b][list]\n<br />[*]Starting a new game is required.

Together, you will have a truly special character creation experience.\n<br />[b][b]\n<br />[/b][b][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/19510]Morrowind Code Patch[/url][/b]\n<br />[/b]There are two features that I [i]highly [/i]recommend using, for quality of life and balance. First, use the feature that fixes slowfall (game mechanics -&gt; slowfall overhaul). I balanced Khajiit's slowfall with this in mind. Without this setting, you will stall midair and slowly float to the ground like paper. Trust me, slowfall +10 feels SO much better with this setting. Second, use the feature that enables NPCs to use racial powers (Mod specific -&gt; NPC AI casts zero cost powers). It will certainly make the game harder, but I feel its a lot more fun when humanoids are especially dangerous, as intelligent opponents would be. You will want to know the race of who you're fighting and strategize around what their power is going to provide for them. [b]\n<br />[b]\n<br />[/b][b][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49912]What Are My Attributes[/url][/b]\n<br />[/b]This will allow you to see the attributes of the races during character creation, as well as the lore/flavor text of the races. For reference, screenshots were taken with this installed. Super helpful, especially if you're like me and have tried out a dozen different race mods and can't remember what each one does. While my mod doesn't change racial attributes, it's always nice to see what they are in real time in case you can't be bothered to alt-tab to the UESP to look up the vanilla values.
