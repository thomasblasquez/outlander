nexusDescription="Rise of House Telvanni 2.0\n<br />by mort\n<br />Version 2.0.7\n<br />\n<br />This mod gives a much needed facelift to one of the greatest quest mods of all time - Rise of House Telvanni.\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/OwTqf4W.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />Original Description:\n<br />\"This is a heavily expanded version of Pozzo's Rise of House Telvanni (RoHT). This mod adds quests for the Telvanni Archmagister, allowing him/her to gain more political power and strengthen House Telvanni.\"\n<br />\n<br />Changes:\n<br />-The Mary-Sue (self-insert?) character has been cut down to an incredible degree. No more vivec face. No more famous ancestors. No more \"finding the Oghma Infinium twice\"\n<br />-Her ancestor has had a similar treatment done. Quests involving both of them no longer reference each other as relatives.\n<br />-The term Archmagistrix is terrible and was changed.\n<br />-The character Zubudaiah is now named Delasa Rethosa. She isn't an Ashlander.\n<br />-Removed bizarrely placed objects (like a dozen vivec heads from a portal gate, why)\n<br />-Lots and lots of dialogue changes. The original authors would use semicolons; where you shouldn't have them. AND LOTS OF YELLING IN ALL CAPS\n<br />-Reduced the amount of gold to give the Mages Guild folks, giving people 25k for the first quest is either really easy if youre a god or near impossible if you have economy fixes.\n<br />-Script fixes, like there were certain books that were unreadable because they had OnActivate returns.\n<br />-No longer are you forced to obliterate the Mages Guild, nor does it give you the trap option of doing nothing\n<br />-Gothren no longer has lorebreaking weird dialogue regarding the other council members\n<br />\n<br />FAQ:\n<br />\"Is this it?\" - No, I plan on changing a bit more of it. There's still some dialogue to go through and I dislike the handling of the Mage's Guild.\n<br />\"Will you do another House?\" - Yeah I'm a Hlaalu guy, if I make my own it's going to be that.\n<br />\"Is this compatible with X?\" - Probably. I can't try every single permutation of mods. Hell I barely play Morrowind anymore. If you notice something broken let me know.\n<br />\"Can I load this if I've already started my game?\" - Yes but expect the first quest to be broken at a very specific part. Delasa Rethosa won't have the right dialogue options. Run\xa0\"journal ROHT_GothrenSuccessor 30\"\xa0 followed by set RoHT_Zubadaiah_status to 1\n<br />in your console and she will agree to join.\n<br />\n<br />Install:\n<br />Load ROHT_2_0.esp alongside the original ROHT.esm\n<br />\n<br />Updates:\n<br />V2.0.8 - Now able to complete MG questline if you already killed trebonius\n<br />V2.0.7 - Changed order of mages guild (for real this time), added some failsafes to prevent previous game glitches. Hopefully this issue is behind me.\n<br />V2.0.6 - You now have an option to not blow up the Mages Guild. You can continue to operate them as a puppet guild forever.\n<br />v2.0.5 - Initial release\n<br />\n<br />Requirements:\n<br />-Rise of House Telvanni (https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/27545)\n<br />\n<br />Licence/Usage:\n<br />MIT Licence"
