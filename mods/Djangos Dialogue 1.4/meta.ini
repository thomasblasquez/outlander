nexusDescription="[b]What's in the mod?[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Hundreds of new lines of text dialogue for all NPCs, which helps to remedy the repetition and dialogue fatigue that came with the original game.\n<br />\n<br />[b]The 1.4 update[/b] is mostly around greetings - new greetings by class, new greetings about your outfit and reputation, and fully filtered dialogue for weather\n<br />and time of day for all shipmasters, caravaneers and publicans.\n<br />\n<br />If you haven't played with the mod before, this also adds...\n<br />\n<br />[b]Background:[/b]\n<br />Hundreds of new backgrounds, filtered by class, and then by race within those classes. Great Houses also have unique backgrounds for their most popular classes - Redoran Warriors, for instance, or Telvanni sorcerers. These have been expanded in 1.4.\n<br />[b]\n<br />Little secret:[/b]\n<br />Over 100 new secrets - some are faction specific, and some are class specific. There are many Dark Elf specific secrets too. These have been expanded in 1.4.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Little advice:[/b]\n<br />Adds about 50 new little advice lines. 1.4 adds specific advice for the Telvanni and Hlaalu, as well as specific advice for commoners so they're not waxing\n<br />lyrical about casting spells or fighting monsters.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Services &amp; Someone in Particular:[/b]\n<br />Originally the 'services' topic simply had one response per city, regardless of where you where. This was pretty immersion breaking.\xa0\n<br />Now Npcs will respond according to where they are, giving a better sense of place and making the game less robotic.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[b]And more:[/b]\n<br />Lots of little tidbits hidden around the game. You can ask the Telvanni and Redoran about other Houses now, or see custom persuasion responses for certain quests. Some small villages have more variety in their rumours.\n<br />\n<br />Cleaned with tesame.\n<br />\n<br />Enjoy the mod!\n<br />\n<br />[b]History:\n<br />[/b]1.44 -\xa0\x41\x64\x64\x65\x64 more variety to how NPCs respond to you having a high bounty.\xa0\n<br />1.43 - Added a series of new 'Little Secrets' that point you towards major and master trainers not mentioned in dialogue\n<br />1.42 - A host of spelling fixes courtesy of Danae.\n<br />1.41 - Rumours -&gt; Rumors, tweaks to publican and caravaneer greetings, more backgrounds, tweaked text for 'service' classes. Telvanni topic for Redoran updated.\n<br />1.4 - Custom greetings, filtered by class, time of day, weather and more\n<br />1.3 - More backgrounds, this time for key classes of the Great Dunmer Houses\n<br />1.2 - Added another 100 entries to the 'background' topic\n<br />1.1 - Added over 300 new entries for the 'background' topic - split by class, race and gender\n<br />1.0 - Initial release, superceeds my old 'little secrets' and 'good service' mods"
