nexusDescription="Based on an old mod called\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50867?tab=description]Bounty Hunters (Main quests reminder)[/url]\xfeff which had a cool idea for the Empire to enforce your parole with the use of bounty hunters that bring you back to Caius Cosades if you neglect doing quests with him for too long. However, NPCs in that mod had overpowered stats that only Gaenor himself could match, and fights would entail scripting that disabled basic player controls and abilities, like jumping and teleportation. Some people might prefer that, Morrowind is an easy game to cheese. But I wanted to set out and iterate my own version of the mod's concept, with my own preferences and approach which involve the use of persistent ambushes should the player successfully evade these formidable foes. Feel free to pick between mine and\xa0Innocent82's mod to see which you prefer.\n<br />\n<br />[u][b][size=4]Features[/size][/b][/u]\n<br />   \xfeff- If you are in an active quest with Caius Cosades and haven't finished it, after some time has passed, you will encounter 1 of several different bounty hunters in your sleep.\n<br />[b]Countdown until visited by bounty hunter:\n<br />[/b][spoiler]7 days[/spoiler]\n<br />   \xfeff- Option given to resist bounty hunters, and can either fight them or escape. Just know; until you comply and return to Caius, they will just keep showing up in your sleep.\n<br />[b]Spoiler tips for stopping the bounty hunters from visiting you:\n<br />[/b][spoiler]Kill them, all of them! Some carry good loot, but their difficulty all range from early-to-late game. They will also stop coming if you progress the main quest to the point where Caius sends you to meet the Urshilaku Ashlanders[/spoiler]\n<br />   \xfeff\xfeff- Extra dialogue from Caius after bounty hunter encounters.\n<br />\n<br />[u][b][size=4]Installation[/size][/b][/u]\n<br />   - Install with your favorite mod manager or extract the .ESP file and place in your game's Data Folder.\n<br />   \xfeff- Open the launch window and enable the ESP.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Compatibilty\n<br />[/b]   \xfeff\xfeff- Report any conflicts you might encounter."
