nexusDescription="[font=Verdana][size=6][center]Thirteen Telvanni - a Dunmeri Card Game[/center][/size][/font][i]This mod was inspired by Tamriel Rebuilt's new Hortator game, which is a single player solitaire variant you can play at a few taverns on the mainland. It was also inspired by the real card game Love Letter and, to a lesser extent, Coup.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />[b]Thirteen Telvanni[/b] is a 2-to-4-player card game you can play at various taverns and other gathering places on Vvardenfell. Yes, the NPCs actually play against you! The game uses the Telvanni suit and Morag Tong card from Tamriel_Data's Dunmer card set. While your own decisions are the driving force behind your success or failure, your character's luck plays a small part in determining how often the other players guess your card correctly.\n<br />\n<br />For most locations, there is a main host NPC, who offers to start a round of the game through the topic \"game of Thirteen Telvanni\". At the present time, there are also two short quests to unlock games in Molag Mar and Suran. Each location has unique ways of choosing the starting player and a specific betting and winning amount.\n<br />\n<br />You can download an optional Tamriel Rebuilt addon to get several more locations on the mainland, with even more variety in how the games are set up. Load the addon after the main Thirteen Telvanni ESP.\n<br />\n<br />Be sure to check out my other minigame mods,\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/52093]Nine-holes[/url]\xa0\x61nd [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/53914]Playable Game of Ur[/url], which nicely complement the locations of this game.\n<br />\n<br />[i]Neither MWSE nor OpenMW are required. This mod uses only native Morrowind scripting.\n<br />\n<br />[b][i]Tamriel_Data is required. The latest releases use loose files, so you don't need to register BSAs.[/i][/b][/i]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4][center]How to Play[/center][/size][/b]\n<br />A rule and strategy book is added to most locations, which NPCs suggest you read. Here is an excerpt from the Rules section:\n<br />\n<br />The card ranks, in order from least to greatest value showing how many are in the deck:\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]2 DUST ADEPTs, least value\n<br />[*]2 ALCHEMISTs\n<br />[*]5 GUARDs\n<br />[*]2 ENCHANTERs\n<br />[*]1 WIZARD\n<br />[*]1 MAGISTER\n<br />[*]2 ASSASSINs, greatest value\n<br />[/list]\n<br />(15 total. 13 not counting the Assassins, hence the name \"Thirteen Telvanni\".)\n<br />\n<br />From the deck, each player is dealt a card face-down. Play proceeds clockwise. On a player's turn, they draw a second card. They can choose either card to put into play on the table, taking the actions described below. Actions will affect another player's card in some way and/or the current player's card that they didn't play. When the action is complete, the card is discarded at random within the remaining deck, with the exception of the Magister (stays out of deck) and Enchanter (discarded later). If a player is put out of the game, their card stays out of the deck.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/mMj1Kj2.png[/img]\xfeff   \xfeff[img]https://i.imgur.com/THvD6pm.png[/img]   \xfeff[img]https://i.imgur.com/4iGVWNF.png[/img]\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\x44UST ADEPT\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 ALCHEMIST\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 GUARD\xfeff\n<br />\n<br />The [b]DUST ADEPT[/b] lets you peek at another player's card. No other players should be able to see this exchange. Should the viewing player announce their discovery, they are out. Expect more than just the loss of your gold and being called an n'wah if you opt for foolery of this sort in a Dunmer establishment.\n<br />\n<br />The [b]ALCHEMIST[/b] gives you the power to require any player, including yourself, to draw a new card and discard the old one.\n<br />\n<br />The [b]GUARD[/b] allows you to make a guess at another player's card, though you cannot guess the Guard himself, as it is the most likely. Should you be correct, that player is out. Again, any sly-minded individual who thinks to lie about having a correctly guessed card would be advised not to frequent Dunmer establishments.\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/ZZJWyYd.png[/img]\xfeff   \xfeff[img]https://i.imgur.com/lBfCZ7j.png[/img]   \xfeff[img]https://i.imgur.com/VGezQNH.png[/img]\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\x45NCHANTER\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 WIZARD\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 MAGISTER\n<br />\n<br />The [b]ENCHANTER[/b] has no target. Rather, place it beside your card to indicate that you are protected from all other actions targeting you until your next turn. When that turn arrives, discard the Enchanter into the deck as usual.\n<br />\n<br />The [b]WIZARD[/b] lets you trade your other card with another player's card.\n<br />\n<br />The [b]MAGISTER[/b] must not be put into play, or you are out. You will lose if another player forces you to discard it using an Alchemist. The only way to remove a Magister is to trade it using the Wizard. Once the Magister is discarded, it does not go back in the deck.\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/ZAU5Cix.png[/img]\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\x41SSASSIN\xfeff\n<br />\n<br />The [b]ASSASSIN[/b] lets you choose a player to attack. If your other card is greater in value than that player's card, they are assassinated and out. Equal ranks are still failed assassinations. The player assassinating discreetly compares the two cards and announces the result, revealing the inferior card if successful.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Once a player is out, they are out until the end of the round, when the last player standing collects the pot. As fewer players compete for the pot, you may run into a situation when Enchanters protect all other players. In this case, any card targeting a player is simply discarded with no effect.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/16Ere0HxFgqsrCdGvZ8qmk9ty6l2dVRdu/view?usp=sharing]View the original, highest resolution images of the card deck here.[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b][center]Card Game Locations[/center][/b][/size]\n<br />On Vvardenfell, there are seven places to play a 4-player game and four places to play a 3-player game.\n<br />\n<br />On [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42145]Tamriel Rebuilt's mainland[/url], there are three 4-player games, four 3-player games, two 2-player games with the winner determined by winning a certain number of rounds first, and one location that can be 2, 3, or 4 players.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][center]4 Players (Vvardenfell)[/center][/size][/b]\n<br />[b]Balmora[/b], South Wall Cornerclub\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Host:   \xfeff   \xfeffPhane Rielle\n<br />[*]Bet:   \xfeff   \xfeff\x31\x35 gold (win 55 -- publican charges a 5 gold fee)\n<br />[*]Goes First:   \xfeffyou until character level 5, then random\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b]Ald-ruhn[/b], Ald Skar Inn\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Host:   \xfeff   \xfeffSkeetul\n<br />[*]Bet:   \xfeff   \xfeff\x32\x30 gold (win 80)\n<br />[*]Goes First:   \xfeffrandom\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b]Gnisis[/b], Madach Tradehouse\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Host:   \xfeff   \xfeffTalms Dralor\n<br />[*]Bet:   \xfeff   \xfeff\x32\x30 gold (win 80)\n<br />[*]Goes First:   \xfeffrandom\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b]Sadrith Mora[/b], Fara's Hole in the Wall\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Host:   \xfeff   \xfeffTedril Vandram\n<br />[*]Bet:   \xfeff   \xfeff\x32\x35 gold (win 100)\n<br />[*]Goes First:   \xfeffrandom, then the winner for each subsequent round\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b]Vivec[/b], Black Shalk Cornerclub\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Host:   \xfeff   \xfeffHylf the Harrier\n<br />[*]Bet:   \xfeff   \xfeff\x32\x35 gold (win 98 -- host charges a 2 gold fee)\n<br />[*]Goes First:   \xfeffrandom, then the player left of the winner for each subsequent round\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b]Suran[/b], Suran Tradehouse\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Host:   \xfeff   \xfeff\x41shumanu Eraishah (via Jamie)\n<br />[*]Bet:   \xfeff   \xfeff\x32\x35 gold (win 90 -- publican charges a 10 gold fee)\n<br />[*]Goes First:   \xfeffrandom\n<br />[*][u]Note[/u]:   \xfeff   \xfeffmust be unlocked through short quest \"Half a Deck\"\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b]Molag Mar[/b], St. Veloth's Hostel\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Host:   \xfeff   \xfeffGoron Lleran (via Geor Matreinace)\n<br />[*]Bet:   \xfeff   \xfeff\x33\x36 gold (win 144)\n<br />[*]Goes First:   \xfeffGoron Lleran, then random for each subsequent round\n<br />[*][u]Note[/u]:   \xfeff   \xfeffmust be unlocked through quest \"Sacred Pastime\";

You may even opt to just have the core files for use as an asset for some other mod. If an incompatibility exists with any location, you can use all the locations that do work. You can always merge them together in the CS if you wish to minimize your plugin count.\n<br />\n<br />[i]Make sure the 00 Core file is always loaded first, before any locations.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />Built-in compatibility exists through the modular files.\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49231]Beautiful Cities of Morrowind[/url]\xfeff (BCOM) \x2014 Replacement versions for Madach Tradehouse and Black Shalk Cornerclub.
