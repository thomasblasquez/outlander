nexusDescription="Magicka Based Skill Progression: MWSE-Lua Edition\n<br />Version 1.0.1\n<br />By JaceyS\n<br />Original by HotFusion4\n<br />\n<br />[b]v1.01 - Fixed a bug which caused Birthsign spells to give Block experience, and added a logo.\n<br />[/b]\n<br />====Requirements====\n<br />\n<br />- Morrowind\n<br />- Tribunal\n<br />- Bloodmoon\n<br />- MGE XE 0.10.1\n<br />- MWSE 2.1+\n<br />\n<br />This mod requires a recent nightly build of MWSE. Please be sure to run the mwse-update.exe before playing this mod.\n<br />\n<br />====Description====\n<br />\n<br />In the default game, you get a fixed amount of skill experience for each casting of spell. This rewards casting the weakest spells possible repeatedly, and makes some schools which favor longer lasting effects (conjuration, alteration) difficult to train by normal usage.\n<br />\n<br />HotFusion4 recognized this problem and fixed it with his Magicka Based Skill Progression, but the way he had to do it was very complicated, due to the limitations of MWScript. With the advantage of MWSE-Lua, I present a much lighter weight and fully configurable version.\n<br />\n<br />===Configuration===\n<br />This mod uses the MCM functionality of MWSE to present configuration options.\n<br />\n<br />Skill Experience Per Magicka: The amount of skill experience awarded per magicka spent on a spell. Vanilla game behavior gives 1 skill experience for each casting, and the default setting of this mod gives 1 skill experience for a 5 magicka casting. Default: 0.2\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />===Permissions===\n<br />You may use the scripting and writing in this mod for any purpose you wish, just give me credit. You have my permission to re-upload this mod in the event that I do not respond to contact on Discord at JaceyS#5136 for a period of 1 week or more. You can send me direct messages if you become a member of the Morrowind Modding Community server.\n<br />\n<br />===Compatibility===\n<br />This mod uses MWSE-Lua, and so is not currently compatible with OpenMW.\n<br />\n<br />This mod should not be used with other mods that modify the experience from spell casting.\n<br />As far as I can tell, it is compatible with Proportional Progression and Class Conscious Character Progression.\n<br />\n<br />If you discover mod incompatibilities, please report them to me on Nexus or at JaceyS#5136 on Discord.\n<br />\n<br />===Issues===\n<br />With default settings, this mod significantly speeds up the natural skill progression of magic skills, while decreasing the progression speed from \"practice casting\" 1 magicka spells. You may consider decreasing the default setting, though I am not sure at what point rounding errors might become a problem. Alternatively, you could use Proportional Progression to raise the experience required to level magic skills.\n<br />\n<br />===Installation &amp; Removal===\n<br />Installation:\n<br />Unpack the archive file such that the top level contents are in your Morrowind&#92;Data Files folder. There is no esp file to activate.\n<br />\n<br />This mod should be safe to load with an in-progress save, but to be safe, don't add it to save that was in the middle of casting a spell.\n<br />\n<br />Removal:\n<br />Refer to the files included in the archive file to find what to delete. Also delete Morrowind&#92;Data Files&#92;MWSE&#92;config&#92;Magicka Based Skill Progression.json.\n<br />No special behavior is required to remove this mod from your save.\n<br />\n<br />==Thanks==\n<br />NullCascade, Merlord, Merzasphor, Greatness7, and OperatorJack, for the ongoing development of MWSE.\n<br />HotFusion4 for recognizing this problem, and providing a fix back in the dark times before MWSE-Lua. This mod is named after his.\n<br />MageKing17, whose Magicka Mastery covered this functionality in non-Lua MWSE, though it was sadly broken by an MWSE update."
