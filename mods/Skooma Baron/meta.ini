nexusDescription="Skooma Baron does:\n<br />1. Combines Merlord's Create Skooma and Skooma dealer scripts into a single mod.\n<br />\n<br />2. Cuts out the originals mods scripting placements on skooma pipe to eliminate conflicts with other popular skooma related mods such as Skoomaesthesia\n<br />\n<br />3. Creates a unique misc item called Skooma Refiner using TR assets to hold the skooma creation scripts. (TR is not a requirement, the skooma refiner meshes and icons are included in the mod).\n<br />\n<br />4. Seeds the item skooma refiner into relevant leveled lists, AND hand places the skooma refiner into the world in places where sufficient amounts of skooma or moonsuger can be found or in places where drug manufacturing would logically be found. \n<br />\n<br />5.\xa0 Modifies the creation of skooma (now it takes 2 pieces of moonsuger for each bottle of skooma) and modifies the selling skooma profit generation script for better balancing. \n<br />\n<br />Selling Script now is as follows:\n<br />set price to ( rand + ( merc * 3.0 ) + ( speech * 4.8 ) )\n<br />set price to ( price + ( per * 1.2 ) + ( luck 0.8 ) + ( alch 0.8 ) )\n<br />set XSkoomaPrice to ( price + 90 + rand2 )\n<br />\n<br />Translated what this means is that your Speechcraft followed by Mercantile are the most heavily weighted skills when it comes to slanging sweet sweet skooma and you get minor bonuses from Personality, Luck and Alchemy as well. The addicts disposition is irrelevant now in the value of street skooma, although selling skooma to someone will still get them to like you more for each sale (+10 disposition), their positive disposition won't cause them to pay you more. Now its entirely dependent on your own skill. \n<br />\n<br />Note: Caius Cosades does not have a skooma refiner anymore because he definitely does not use skooma :) \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Updates:\n<br />Relevant containers now have a chance of dropping ingredients that are commonly used to cut skooma (cutting is diluting skooma with harmful and/or waste products for greater profits). Included is the new ingredient \"potion waste\" which will allow you to use ingredient \"poison\" effects in alchemy now.\n<br />\n<br />Moonsuger containers now have a variable amount of moonsuger in them.\n<br />\n<br />Moved assets to be compatible with Arrille's Tradehouse Third Floor by YolkOfTime\n<br />\n<br />The book Confessions of a Dunmer Skooma Eater now has a script that will add the topic \"skooma\" to the player for those who wish to jump right away into \n<br />selling skooma. The book can be found rarely in smuggler containers. Certain relevant npcs also have this book now but are unlikely to openly sell it.\n<br />\n<br />Slightly bumped up the skooma scripts to make selling skooma more profitable."
