nexusDescription="[size=4][b][center]Showcase by Morrowind Modding Showcases\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[youtube]4zDxs6-r0Sc[/youtube][/center][/b][center]\xfeff[/center]\n<br />\n<br />I love the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/41298]StoneWood pass[/url]. It\x2019s one of my favourite mods. After\xa0many years of playing with it, there were a couple of things I decided to change as they felt a bit off.\n<br />\n<br />- Removed the pines: they\x2019re Solstheim stuff, not fitting for the West Gash\n<br />\n<br />- Reduced the number of rocks: FPS issues plus too many\xa0statics made the landscape look overly detailed compared to the rest\n<br />\n<br />- Reworked rocks placement: having many rocks scaled\xa0to 2.0 and rotated almost horizontally looks unnatural from a distance\n<br />\n<br />- Reworked the entire pass so it looks less broken and\xa0\x61\x62\x61ndoned. Walking through an abandoned pass up the mountains is cool, but when you think about it from a lore perspective, does it make sense that the road between Balmora (the main city of house Hlaalu) and Cladera (the city with the biggest ebony mine in Morrowind) is completely abandoned? It\x2019s still a lonely walk up the mountains, but now it looks like there\x2019s some maintenance going on.\n<br />\n<br />- Removed the chasm and the invisible collision walls: interesting detail but vanilla MW doesn't do that[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]The [b]real genius of original mod[/b] was, in my opinion:[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]- Forcing you into a path to make the\xa0\x64istance between Balmora and Caldera feel much bigger\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[size=4]- Making good use of the rocky atmosphere\xa0of the West Gash[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]This is what I tried to preserve.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]That being said, I hope you enjoy the mod :)\n<br />\n<br />[/size][b][size=5]Compatibility[/size][/b][size=4]\n<br />\n<br />Differently from the original one, [b]this is meant to be used with vanilla rocks and trees[/b]. It can be used with vanilla friendly rocks and trees replacers of course, like [url=http://mw.modhistory.com/download-51-13485]correct UV rocks [/url]and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44173]MD's West Gash trees replcer.[/url]\n<br />\n<br />Patches available here:\n<br />\n<br />- [b]Foyada Mamaea Overhaul[/b]\n<br />- [b][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/52840]Caldera Mine Expanded - Simplified and bug free[/url][/b]\n<br />- [b]Traveling merchants[/b]\n<br />- Riders by Rotat\n<br />\n<br />Already compatible with Beautiful Cities of Morrowind/Balmora Seat of Power.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b]Loard order\n<br />[/b]Taking into account all the conflicting mods that I know of, this is the load order:[/size]\n<br />[size=4]\n<br />DD_Caldera_Expansion.esp\n<br />Foyada Mamaea Overhaul.ESP\n<br />Better Landscapes Stonewood Pass (RP Edit).esp\n<br />Beautiful cities of Morrowind.ESP\n<br />SWP - Foyada Mamaea Overhaul Patch.ESP\n<br />SWP - Caldera Mine Patch.ESP[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b]Credits[/b]\n<br />Mag1cWind0w: original mod\n<br />Melchior Dahrk: stone bridge resource[/size]"
