nexusDescription="Bothered by the fact that Drerel and Falanu Indaren spend the remainder of the game in the same spot outside Ald'ruhn after being reunited? Does your heart ache for Rollie being left to wait indefinitely on the crossroads near Vivec? Well, this is the mod for you! The quests and NPCs that GAMA covers are documented [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46797?tab=docs]here[/url].\n<br />\n<br />As this plugin adds some new dialogue, modded scripts, and a few journal adjustments, I would recommend loading GAMA after other mods that alters any of these aspects of the game to ensure GAMA functions properly, and also not install mid-game. [b]Also recommended to start a new game if upgrading from version 1.xx to 2.0.[/b]\n<br />\n<br />GAMA has been cleaned with Tes3cmd.\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/Jr89swa.png[/img]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/oz1tzdN.png[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/nOMhiUj.png[/img]\xfeff\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/RYTdJjN.png[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/fqZc49T.png[/img]\xfeff[/center]"
