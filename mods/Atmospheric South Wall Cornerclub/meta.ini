nexusDescription="[b][size=4][center]\xfeff[youtube]55Y0nEvbzxY[/youtube][/center][/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]There's an old mod called [url=http://mw.modhistory.com/download-15-13449]South Wall, Den of Iniquity[/url]\xfeff, which made something interesting with the South Wall Cornerclub, making it much shadier and belivable as a base of operation of the Thieves Guild.\n<br />Problem is, the mod did many other things other than overhauling the place, and also had a lot outdated assets and animations made before Antares released Animated Morrowind.\n<br />\n<br />With this mod, I simply took what the author of that mod had done with the cornerclub, took it out of the mod, replaced the npcs with properly animated ones, split the cell so it doesn't lag anymore, made some additional changes here and there, and here we are.\n<br />\n<br />Since the mod changes the layout of the main room a bit and also adds some animated npcs to it, it needs a patch for Animated Morrowind.\n<br />There are two patches here:\n<br />- One is based on the esp provided [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48683]here[/url] (grab the assets if you don't already have them)\n<br />- The other is based on [url=http://abitoftaste.altervista.org/morrowind/index.php?option=downloads&amp;task=info&amp;id=39&amp;Itemid=50]abot's version\n<br />\n<br />[/url]IF YOU'RE USING Beautiful Cities of Morrowind, just use the Animated Morrowind esp bundled there as it's already compatible with this.\n<br />\n<br />I hope you like the mod,\n<br />Cheers![/size]"
