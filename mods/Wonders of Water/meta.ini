When using MGE XE's water, different weathers will produce different wave heights. Water visibility also changes with depth, an effect that can be countered with Night Eye.\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3]Requirements &amp; Installation[/size][/b]:\n<br />[i]This mod uses MWSE. If you encounter any issues please post a report, ideally on the [url=https://github.com/MWSE/MWSE/issues]MWSE bug tracker[/url]. You can download the latest nightly build from the link below.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />This mod requires [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/41102]Morrowind Graphic Extender XE[/url]. Older versions will not work with MWSE 2.0+. Additionally, it will require the [url=https://github.com/MWSE/MWSE/releases/download/build-automatic/mwse.zip]latest nightly build of MWSE.[/url] Be sure to run the MWSE updater before installing this mod.\n<br />\n<br />To install the mod, extract the archive into your Data Files folder. There is no ESP to activate.\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3]Features[/size][/b]:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] Weather-based MGE XE water changes. Bodies of water will be calm during snow, and have more significant waves during storms. Weather can also adjust the clarity of the water, as well as its caustics.\n<br />[*] Dynamic underwater visibility. The deeper you go, the tighter the darkness grips you. The Night Eye spell effect is good at pushing back the darkness, and increases the distance you can see underwater.\n<br />[*] Vampires, or those otherwise susceptible to sun damage, may find sanctuary in the dark depths of the sea. Sun damage scales down with depth as well.\n<br />[*] A Mod Config Menu is available to customize the mod's features. You can disable and enable features as desired, and change the values used for each weather.\n<br />[/list]"
