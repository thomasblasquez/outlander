nexusDescription="This is a quest/companion/weapon mod inspired by the Malham Companion Weapon mod by MementoMoritius and TheDrunkenMudcrab, and, admittedly, the anime Soul Eater. It involves piecing together the once-powerful Daedra shapeshifter Felthorn, retrieving its shards that were scattered across Vvardenfell and feeding it the hearts and souls of the fallen. Will you help it achieve \"perfection\"?\n<br />\n<br />To get started, look for a skeleton in the back tunnels of Addamasartus. You will find a peculiar blade lodged in its ribcage.\n<br />\n<br />============================\n<br />\xa0 Features\n<br />============================\n<br />\n<br />Felthorn is a versatile shapeshifting companion that can take on the form of any weapon type or any Daedra, if you provide it with the means to do so. Feeding Felthorn a soul gem filled with Daedra soul will allow it to add that creature's form to its repertoire, and locating lost weapon fragments will similarly unlock the corresponding weapon types.\n<br />\n<br />Felthorn will slowly grow in power, based on the player's level and offerings of gems, ores, and Daedra hearts. Once fully realized, it will be on par with many artifacts, and many times more adaptable.\n<br />\n<br />In creature form, Felthorn functions as a fully capable (if lightweight) companion. Some compromises were made due to its unusual nature, a lack of Companion Share being a big example.\n<br />\n<br />The -Felthorn- spell lets you speak to Felthorn if it is both in weapon form and on your person, and teleports Felthorn to you while in creature form.\n<br />\n<br />If you follow Felthorn's quest all the way to the end, you will unlock two additional creature transformations apart from its basic lineup.\n<br />\n<br />Thanks for playing!\n<br />\n<br />============================\n<br />\xa0 Considerations\n<br />============================\n<br />\n<br />Do NOT update from an earlier version with an ongoing save. The mod will almost certainly break.\n<br />\n<br />Versions earlier than 1.5 are only compatible with OpenMW, but 1.5 and on should be fully compatible with both.\n<br />\n<br />============================\n<br />\xa0 New in 1.6\n<br />============================\n<br />\n<br />Added BCoM compatibility for two scouts, thanks to Sophie on MMC discord!\n<br />\n<br />Greatly improved follower travel behavior. Felthorn will now teleport with you while in follow mode when you use intervention spells, recall, propylon chambers, Mazed Band, or the -Felthorn- spell, regardless of distance. Also, Felthorn will now teleport behind you if you get too far ahead while travelling (drawing your weapon prevents this behavior)."
