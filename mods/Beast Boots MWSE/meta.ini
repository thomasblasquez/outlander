nexusDescription="[b]About:[/b]\n<br />This mod makes all boots equippable by beast races. By using MWSE, this is done seamlessly without requiring separate boot items for beast races. The only requirement is that the boots must include an ankle piece. Beast races can also cast Bound Boots.\n<br />\n<br />An additional ESP is included to provide additonal beast-specific meshes for the boots that don't include an ankle piece. This enables beasts to equip Heavy Leather Boots, Nordic Mail Boots, Ice Armor Boots and Ten Pace Boots.\n<br />\n<br />This should work for any mod-added boots as long as they include an ankle piece. Any that don't will need to be patched separately.\n<br />\n<br />[b]How it works:[/b]\n<br />Behind the scenes, this mod 'erases' all foot parts from boots, enabling beast races to equip them without limitation. Then for non-beast races, the foot part of the mesh is added back through the use of bodyPartAssigned.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Requirements:[/b]\n<br />MGE XE 0.10.1+\n<br />MWSE 2.1+\n<br />Not compatible with OpenMW\n<br />\n<br />[b]Recommended mods:\n<br />[/b][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49654]Character Sound Overhaul[/url] by Anumaril21 - use this to get the game to play appropriate footstep sounds for beasts wearing boots\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42509]Better Morrowind Armor[/url] by Moranar\n<br />\n<br />[b]Credits:[/b]\n<br />Beast-specific meshes based on Better Morrowind Armor by Moranar - https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42509\n<br />Inspired by Adul's Leggings and other similar mods - http://adul.net/?p=dl_mwmods_aduls_leggings"
