nexusDescription="[size=4]I think we can all agree that the Caldera Mine is just a huge disappointment. The game hypes it up to be something quite remarkable while\xa0it is, in reality, a dull and tiny site with nothing unique about it.\n<br />\n<br />Luckily\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45194]Caldera Mine Expanded[/url]\xa0\x64id a fantastic job with it. The issue with the mod is that the new quests seem to be quite buggy. I don't really play the game much, but after a quick test to check if the mod was as buggy as the comment section makes it out to be, I found myself stuck with a constantly exploding Caldera Mine which could be heard all the way from Caldera.\n<br />This motivated me to make a quick edit, removing everything apart from the scenic/aesthetic part of the mod, which is what I'm mostly interested in anyway.\n<br />\n<br />I also learned that the original mod has never been tested on OpenMW, so I guess this also makes it 100% compatible with it as an unexpected bonus.\n<br />\n<br />While I was at it, I also made some minor edits like swapping the flat-darkness doors for better meshes from OAAB, and the cranes for OAAB-counterparts.\n<br />\n<br />There's not much else to say, cheers!\n<br />\n<br />[b]Credits[/b]\n<br />DD Team and all the people mentioned in the original modpage[/size]"
