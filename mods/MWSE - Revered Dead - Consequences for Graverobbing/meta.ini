nexusDescription="[img]https://i.imgur.com/ucf9DrV.png[/img]\n<br />Part of the May Modathon Month 2023!\n<br />\n<br />Burial places are said to be extremely important in Dunmer culture, so why are you allowed to rummage around in grandma's ashes like you're looking for a toy in the bottom of a cereal box, and have nobody bat an eye? No more!\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=5]Description[/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />This MWSE mod is intended to improve immersion by adding a variety of complex interactions surrounding the shameless plundering of sacred burial places.\n<br />Honest merchants may refuse to trade in grave goods, openly wearing graverobbed items may draw ire, and trading in [i]actual mortal remains[/i] is likely to really piss people off. But it's all dependent on who you're talking to, what they think of you, and exactly what is it you're trying to sell.\n<br />\n<br />There is some functionality similarity to the contraband systems in [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50574]Buying Game[/url], which this mod compliments nicely!\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=5]Features[/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Items in tombs will be identifiable as grave goods by most merchants, provided they're obvious/valuable enough. Some dried leaves or an old dagger? Unlikely to result in a second glance. Some nice gloves? Maybe if somebody gets a good look. Grandma's prize battleaxe? You monster!\n<br />[*]Detailed trust system for how people react to your misdeeds. A total stranger shows up with something which might be stolen? [i]And[/i] they're an outlander? Report them immediately! But the head of your guild just showed up, you're buddies, I think we can let that slide. They probably have a legitimate reason to be pawning your great uncle's belongings anyway, they [i]do[/i] work for the temple after all.\n<br />[*]Configurable elements. Adjustable type and value thresholds for what is considered identifiable as grave goods, what is obviously grave goods to the naked eye, and the criminal penalty associated with graverobbing. The additional taboo for attempting to sell bones taken from a tomb can also be disabled, as well as a reminder when entering a sacred tomb.\n<br />[*]A wide variety of dialogue additions, including integration with NPCs during certain vanilla quests related to ancestral tombs. Surrender your grave goods to a guard for a reduced fine if you like, just note that some may react more strongly than others!\n<br />[*]Grave goods can be 'cleaned' at a few specific NPCs, allowing them to be sold at normal merchants - for a fee. Hints to their location can be found in dialogue. \n<br />[/list]\n<br />Generally, Dunmer and/or \"respectable\" people will have stronger reactions to your attempted sales. Thieves and smugglers on the other hand will probably not mind much at all and buy without a second thought, unless they really don't like you for a variety of other reasons. Dunmer thieves? It's complicated for them!\n<br />A full list of conditions for strong/indifferent reactions can be found [url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cR-ms3_YBbd0XdEWROMNDQDz6dN7HcqHD6LHt3BWB0c]here[/url]\xfeff if you don't mind \"spoilers\".\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][b]Requirements[/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />This mod requires the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45468]Morrowind Script Extender (MWSE)[/url] to function!\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=5]Compatibility[/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />The majority of this mod's functionality is achieved through lua scripting and MWSE, and as such is [b]not compatible[/b] with OpenMW. If their scripting systems ever reach parity with MWSE, or the lua systems are made compatible, I may create a port.\n<br />\n<br />This mod does not touch any existing cells, objects, or NPCs directly (Any new NPC dialogue is limited to one new dialogue topic, \"grave goods\") and its functionality is achieved through scripts. As such, it should be[b] fully compatible [/b]with any mod that alters existing or adds additions Ancestral Tombs. I highly encourage the use of mods like [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49131]OAAB - Tombs and Towers[/url] and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/56484]Waresified Urns[/url] to further enhance the tomb experience, and maybe even put something in them worth looting in the first place!\n<br />\n<br />Special item considerations are entirely script based and already account for basic [b][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49042]OAAB_Data[/url][/b] and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44537]Tamriel_Data[/url] items, but will function [b]with or without[/b] those mods installed.\n<br />\n<br />Special exclusions have been added so that cells in [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42347]Sotha Sil Expanded[/url]\xfeff and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42145]Tamriel Rebuilt[/url]\xfeff that contain \"Ancestral Tomb\" but are not strictly ancestral tombs, are not flagged as burial places.\n<br />\n<br />This mod was designed to work well with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50574]Buying Game[/url] and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49086]Silver Tongue[/url].\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=5]Problems?[/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Please report any conflicts or odd behaviour you notice, either running this mod alone or interacting with others!\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Whitelists are provided for known vanilla quest items and containers that exist inside tombs, to prevent them from being unintentionally marked as grave goods or confiscated.\n<br />[*]If I have missed any items, containers, or entire locations that you think should be excluded from grave good flagging, please let me know!\n<br />[*]If you would like me to provide compatibility with any mod I will be happy to account for them in the scripts, as the magic of lua means this would be almost seamless and not even require additional patch versions!\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b][size=5]Known Issues[/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />None currently.\n<br />\n<br />Potential future features:\n<br />Configurable inclusion of Nord Barrows as sacred spaces?\n<br />Even more [url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cR-ms3_YBbd0XdEWROMNDQDz6dN7HcqHD6LHt3BWB0c]conditions[/url] for trust/distrust and further granular reactions? Tell me if you think I missed something obvious!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/htPWgF5.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/HSZzbe8.png[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/qtRIYJ0.png[/img]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/3cu6ed7.png[/img]\xfeff[img]https://i.imgur.com/RHOmclk.png[/img]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/XSnAX1H.png[/img]\xfeff[img]https://i.imgur.com/YVh3EyZ.png[/img]"
