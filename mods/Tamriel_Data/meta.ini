We will make the new Lua-based features available in OpenMW-Lua too, as soon as it becomes possible.\n<br />\n<br />The 2 BSAs have been split back into 3 due to file size issues. See below for details on re-registering your BSAs.\n<br />\n<br />Due to a large number of deprecations, the\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/52000/?tab=description]Tamriel_Data Graveyard[/url]\xa0mod was created to ensure compatibility with mods depending on Tamriel_Data\n<br />\n<br />[b][u][size=5]What is Tamriel_Data?[/size]\n<br />[/u][/b]Tamriel_Data is first and foremost an [b]asset repository[/b]. It contains meshes, textures, books, and region data that can be used by other mods.\n<br />\n<br />It originated from the works of the biggest Morrowind province mods, [url=http://project-tamriel.com/]Project Tamriel[/url] and [url=https://www.tamriel-rebuilt.org/]Tamriel Rebuilt[/url] and contains not only their assets, but a unified, logical file structure, making their assets easily accessible not only for their modders, but for other projects too.\n<br />\n<br />Additionally, Tamriel_Data supplies both vanilla-style resources (Tamriel Rebuilt standard) and a high-resolution alternative (Project Tamriel standard), making sure the assets do not look out of place even if graphical replacers that only cover vanilla Morrowind assets are used. \n<br />\n<br />[b]Note[/b]: While the assets for Project Tamriel are all available in both high and low resolution, Tamriel Rebuilt does not have a full selection of HD textures. Any texture artists willing to help are welcome! Please visit the website!\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][u][b]Reporting Bugs and Ongoing Development[/b][b]\n<br />[/b][/u][/size]Bug reports for Tamriel_Data can be done via\xa0[url=https://github.com/TD-Addon/TD_Addon/issues]Github[/url].\xa0\n<br />\n<br />If you would like to follow the development of Tamriel_Data's assets, or if you have assets you would like to submit, you can join the Discord servers for [url=https://discord.gg/9T6TtNU]Tamriel Rebuilt[/url] and [url=https://discord.gg/waZcqnF]Project Tamriel[/url].\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][b][u]MWSE-Lua\n<br />[/u][/b][/size]For the first time, Tamriel_Data version 9 contains a small optional MWSE addon. As of now the addon includes new conjuration spells to summon our new Daedra creatures. To use these features you will need to have an up to date [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/41102]MGE XE[/url] installed.\n<br />\n<br />Anything covered in our MWSE addon will be remade for OpenMW as soon as it's possible.\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=5][u]Patching savegames and mods\n<br />[/u][/size][/b]Tamriel_Data contains a filepatcher directory, within it are a .jar and a .txt file. Both are necessary if you need to patch other files.\n<br />\n<br />If you have mods or savegames that rely on one of the old asset ESMs (TR_Data.esm, PC_Data.esm, or Sky_Data.esm), you will need to run the patcher over your mods and savegames! It will [b]update your dependencies[/b] to point to Tamriel_Data.esm as well as the new asset names.\n<br />\n<br />First, make sure you have a [url=https://www.google.de/search?q=java+runtime+environment]JRE installed[/url]. If you don\x2019t have one, the patcher will behave as if it was an archive (Windows will try to unpack it), when it\x2019s actually an exectuable file.\n<br />Run the TR_FilePatcher and choose one or more savegames or mods to patch. Make sure to save backup copies!\n<br />\n<br /> [center][img width=621,height=502]http://i.imgur.com/ZiJHgbf.png[/img]\n<br />[i]Choose and patch...[/i][/center]\n<br /> [center][img]http://i.imgur.com/PfYbGWA.png[/img]\n<br />[i]...and done![/i][/center]\n<br />\n<br />If you are updating save games that were saved while using Tamriel Rebuilt build 16.09 or earlier, they will contain different region and city names, along with reference changes that the patcher can't solve. Make sure to [url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Tes3Mod:Repairing_Saves]clean your save[/url] afterwards with Wrye Mash or Enchanted Editor, as you normally would.\n<br />\n<br /> [b][size=5][u]Tamriel_Data for modders\n<br />[/u][/size][/b]Tamriel_Data is free to use as a master file, for more detailed permissions please refer to the text files contained in the download archive.\n<br />\n<br />Why would you want to use it if you are modder?\n<br />\n<br />The most obvious benefit is, of course, more resources. You can never have enough meshes, textures, ingredients, and books.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />The real benefit lies in the unified, consistent name structure, which enables modders to easily understand the item they are placing and\n<br /> the context it has in the game. \n<br />This has become a necessity for the big province mods, as Tamriel Rebuilt moves closer to the southern parts that border Cyrodiil, and Skyrim: Home of the Nords moves eastwards to Morrowind. Not only are we able to share our assets, we are avoiding a lot of doublettes in three different ESMs. \n<br />For more information about the naming scheme, please refer to the article tab.\n<br />\n<br /> Of course, the names still have a character limit. Nothing is perfect until the release date of [url=https://openmw.org/]OpenMW[/url], after all.\n<br />\n<br />[u][b][size=5]Nexus Dontations[/size][/b][b]\n<br />[/b][/u][size=2]Any and all donations through nexus will be used to help with hosting costs for Tamriel Rebuilt and Project Tamriel's web server.\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=5][u]Using old versions of Tamriel_Data\n<br />[/u][/size][/b]Prior to version 10.1 of Tamriel_Data, BSA archives were used.[b]\n<br />\n<br />Register your BSAs[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Tamriel_Data.esm replaces TR_Data.esm, PC_Data.esm, and Sky_Data.esm. [b]If you have used one of the big three province mods[/b] (Tamriel Rebuilt, Skyrim: Home of the Nords, Province: Cyrodiil), you \n<br />will be able to use only Tamriel_Data.esm in the future and uncheck all \n<br />the other resource ESMs. Similarily, the previously two BSAs became \n<br />three BSAs: PT_Data.bsa has become redundant and can be deleted.\n<br />\n<br />[b]If you just started out with Morrowind[/b] and have no installed any of these before, make sure to register your BSAs!\n<br />\n<br />What does that mean? \n<br />First, make sure you have the files installed correctly - the BSAs and ESMs go\n<br /> in your Data Files folder. Activate the ESMs via Wrye Mash or the \n<br />Morrowind Launcher, as you would any other mod.\n<br />Then locate the Morrowind.ini in your Morrowind game directory, find the [Archives] section, add the three new BSAs ([b]TR_Data.bsa[/b], [b]PC_Data.bsa[/b], and [b]Sky_Data.bsa[/b]), done. If PT_Data.bsa is still there, delete it. [b]If you use OpenMW[/b], you will need to reimport your Morrowind.ini.\n<br />\n<br /> Alternatively, you can of course use [url=http://mw.modhistory.com/download--5212]BSAReg (link is external)[/url], which ususally takes care of that automatically.\n<br />\n<br /> [img]https://i.imgur.com/rg4zujj.jpeg[/img]\xfeff\n<br />[i]Example setups[/i]\n<br />\n<br /> Just make sure that your Tamriel_Data is up to date, the province mods \n<br />will tell you which version you need to have installed. Registering your\n<br /> BSAs is only necessary once, but it is critically important.\n<br />\n<br />For a more detailed explanation, including Mod Organizer 2 instructions, [url=https://www.tamriel-rebuilt.org/about/frequently-asked-questions/bsa]read this post[/url].\n<br />[/size]\n<br /> [b][size=5][u]The road ahead\n<br />[/u][/size][/b]As Tamriel_Data unifies the data of three province mods, it might evolve into its own framework. Similar to COBL, it contains fully lore-friendly, consistent additions to meshes, textures, food, books, regions, factions, and so much more.\n<br />\n<br /> Last but not least, this is a definite statement from both projects: we're in this together, for the long haul."
