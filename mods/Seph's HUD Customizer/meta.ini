nexusDescription="[center][u][b][size=4][size=5]Description[/size][/size][/b][/u]\n<br />This mod makes almost every element of the HUD customizable to a certain degree.\n<br />It has a very large set of customization options. Please look below for more information on configuration.\n<br />The look and feel of the vanilla UI is almost completely unchanged with only a few elements slightly moved.\n<br />If you don't like these changes you can easily readjust them in the configuration menu.\n<br />The days of the static and ugly HUD are ending. Make your own HUD!\n<br />\n<br />[u][b][size=4][size=5]Compatibility[/size][/size][/b][/u]\n<br />OpenMW: [color=#ff0000]Not Compatible[/color]\n<br />Aleist3r's Clock Block: [color=#00ff00]Compatible\n<br />[/color]OperatorJack's HUD Encumbrance Bar: [color=#00ff00]Compatible\n<br />[/color]NullCascade's Memory Monitor: [color=#00ff00]Compatible\n<br />[color=#ffffff]NullCascade's Controlled Consumption:[/color] [color=#00ff00]Compatible[/color]\n<br />[/color]Mort's Stealth Improved: [color=#00ff00]Compatible\n<br />[/color]JaceyS' Map and Compass: [color=#00ff00]Compatible[/color]\n<br />Merlord's Ashfall: [color=#ffff00][color=#00ff00]Compatible[/color]\n<br />[/color]\n<br />Mods that affect the HUD may be incompatible.

This is due to HUD elements not being resized in Morrowind,\n<br />as well as the relative positioning of HUD elements done by HUD Customizer.\n<br />You can easily adjust their positions back to where you want them to be, which is probably why you installed the mod in the first place.\n<br />\n<br />[u][b][size=4][size=5]Thanks[/size][/size][/b][/u]\n<br />To Danae for picking it as mod of the week:\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://imgur.com/xDhlqQN.png[/img]\xfeff[/center]"
