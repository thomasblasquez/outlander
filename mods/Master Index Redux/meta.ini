nexusDescription="[center][i]\"The Master Index is what I hope to make out of all my research. It combines the combined magical patterns and enchantments into one, making a universal index for all of the propylons on Vvardenfel. Of course, to make it I'd need to copy the enchantment from the other indexes first, which is where you'd help in my project.\"\n<br />[/i][img]https://i.imgur.com/ZnGHipv.png[/img]This mod intends to revise certain aspects of the Master Index official plugin and make it more streamlined and sensible.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/luvf8WF.png[/img][/center][left]This mod changes several aspects of the Master Index quest and plugin, including\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Edits to dialogue and quest entries.\n<br />[*]The functionality of the Master Index has changed, now involving the use of a new propylon in the Caldera mages guildhall. \n<br />[*]Some quest aspects have changed, including the acquisition of certain propylon indices.\n<br />[*]Some alterations to the Caldera mages guildhall, including a basement workshop for Folms and his custom Propylon.\n<br />[/list][/left]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\xfeff[left][img]https://i.imgur.com/UeoJqgf.png[/img]\n<br />This mod is built on the original plugin, meaning you only need to download this mod. This means it's incompatible with the original mod, and any other Master Index mod for that matter. It may also conflict with any mods that edit the interrior of the Mages guildhall or Irgola's pawnshop in Caldera. \n<br />\n<br />Versions of this mod from 1.1 onwards are incompatible with earlier versions, meaning you might have to start a new character to use the latest version of this mod.\n<br />\n<br />There is an incompatibility with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49231]Beautiful Cities of Morrowind[/url]\xfeff that edits the Caldera guildhall, requiring a use of a patch on the BCOM page.\n<br />\n<br />This mod has been tested and works with \xfeff[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45750]Caldera Mage's Guild Expanded[/url]\xfeff. \n<br />\n<br />There is a compatibility patch availible for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43733]Caldera Mage's Quarters[/url], which should be loaded after Caldera Mage's Quarters.[/left]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\xfeff[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/OInYVTx.png[/img]\n<br />As long as you give a credit to my work, I don't mind anyone uploading modifications of this mod or assets.\n<br />\n<br />Thanks to Sanityabsence for their [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46322]Advance Master Index[/url]\xfeff script which was adapted for this mod, and of course thanks too Bethesda and Ken Rolson for making the original Master Index mod and assets.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[u]Some recommended mods:[/u]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44509]Improved Propylon Particles[/url]\xfeff by starwarsgal9875:\n<br />Adds nicer, more FPS-friendly particles which fill the entire propylon chamber.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/19600]\xfeffPropylon Pillar Retexture[/url]\xfeff by Alaisiagae:\n<br />Adds glowmaps to the propylon pillar text, adding some nice visual variety.[/center]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\xfeff[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/MqjOu2c.png[/img]\xfeff[/center]"
