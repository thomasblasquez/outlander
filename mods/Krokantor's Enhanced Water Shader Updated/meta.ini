nexusDescription="Enhanced Water Shader for MGE XE\n<br />by Krokantor\n<br />Version: 2.2\n<br />\n<br />Updated for MGE XE 0.13.0 by Hrnchamd\n<br />\n<br />==========\n<br />=Contents=\n<br />==========\n<br />1. Installation\n<br />2. Requirements\n<br />3. Description\n<br />4. Features\n<br />5. Changes\n<br />6. Credits\n<br />7. Permissions\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />================\n<br />=1.Installation=\n<br />================\n<br />\n<br />Backup \"Underwater Effects.fx\" found in Data files&#92;shaders&#92;XEshaders.\n<br />\n<br />Choose a colour scheme, Green-Blue, Blue, or Green. Extract the contents of the corresponding named directory to Data Files, or use a mod manager like Wrye Mash or MO2.\n<br />\n<br />For uninstallation restore your backup.\n<br />\n<br />================\n<br />=2.Requirements=\n<br />================\n<br />\n<br />Dynamic ripples option (found in In MGE XE Distant Land tab) must be activated to make this work. To have the peak fix work properly I suggest a value of 40.\n<br />\n<br />Requires MGE XE 0.13.0 or later:\n<br />https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/26348\n<br />\n<br />===============\n<br />=3.Description=\n<br />===============\n<br />\n<br />This is a reworked version of the MGE XE standard water shader. A lot of code from a lot of different water shaders was included, tweaked,\n<br />stitched together and forced to team play. So a major part of credit goes to the modders who originally came up with the appropriate code.\n<br />See credits section.\n<br />\n<br />Optional features:\n<br />\n<br />You can edit features at the top of the shader, located in Data Files/shaders/core-mods/XE Mod Water.fx\n<br />\n<br />- Sewer waves, for ripples around Vivec and Molag Mar sewers. It is very heavy and both increases load times by 30 seconds and affects frame rate in exteriors. Not recommended except for screenshots.\n<br />- Distant waves.\n<br />- Foam whitecaps.\n<br />- Colour settings in the tweakables block.\n<br />\xa0\n<br />============\n<br />=4.Features=\n<br />============\n<br />\n<br />Different water color with a more reflective surface, different wave behavior and depth gradient. Greater depths will have a darker color. Also \n<br />sky color and color of sunlight contribute to water color. Overall color is a light blue.\n<br />\n<br />Improved caustics by vtastek.\n<br />\n<br />Peak fix by vtastek. The original MGE XE water shader would have let you peak under the water surface. This is exploit is no more possible.\n<br />\n<br />Heavily tweaked foam. Foam will be generated on water shores as well as on wave tips. Foam is generated in every weather and also very subtly visible\n<br />during nights.\n<br />\n<br />Ripples produced by the player will no longer trigger foam. Every other water shader with foam had this behavior and it bothered me big time.\n<br />\n<br />Comes with a underwater effects shader for corresponding colors underwater.\n<br />\n<br />fps impact is not different from standard MGE XE water shader, except sewer waves option.\n<br />\n<br />===========\n<br />=5.Changes=\n<br />===========\n<br />\n<br />2.0 to 2.2\n<br />===========\n<br />- Updated to use MGE XE core-mods. All versions included in one package.\n<br />- Tweaked green version not to look like Brawndo.\n<br />\n<br />1.3 to 2.0\n<br />===========\n<br />- completely reworked colors\n<br />- fixed depth color\n<br />- better looking normals with more subtle tiling\n<br />- foam on wave tips in stormy weather\n<br />- re-included water cut feature by vtastek\n<br />- optional waves in far normals\n<br />- swell waves with optional foam, quite subtle by default\n<br />- lots of fixes and reworked code\n<br />\n<br />1.3 to 1.3b\n<br />===========\n<br />- only changes to underwater effects shader in this update:\n<br />- fixed sunrays, didn't work previously\n<br />- fixed underwater color and sun ray behavior during nights and bad weather\n<br />- added slight chromatic abberration effect\n<br />- increased wobble\n<br />\n<br />1.2 to 1.3\n<br />==========\n<br />- much better transition from water edge to shore\n<br />- better adjustment of far normals movement speed relative to near normals\n<br />\n<br />1.1 to 1.2\n<br />==========\n<br />- reworked wave behavior to avoid flickering\n<br />- added chromatic abberation effect to refraction\n<br />- reworked water colors\n<br />- made normals stronger\n<br />- lots of little tweaks here and there\n<br />\n<br />===========\n<br />=6.Credits=\n<br />===========\n<br />\n<br />vtastek for general help, peak fix, improved caustics, optimized sewer waves and bits and pieces of code here and there.\n<br />\n<br />phal and harnlarnm for original foam code and sewer waves.\n<br />\n<br />abot for sewer waves port.\n<br />\n<br />===============\n<br />=7.Permissions=\n<br />===============\n<br />\n<br />You can do with this shader what you want as long as you give proper credit to the original authors and me.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />***\n<br />Date of this readme: 2021.06.12"
