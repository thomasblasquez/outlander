nexusDescription="[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/CBAElYb.png[/img]\xfeff[/center][u]Summary[/u]\n<br />As a low-impact, immersive way to start the Main Quest when using an alternate start mod, Imperial Guards in Caldera, Ebonheart, Fort Moonmoth, Pelagiad and Seyda Neen will tell you that Sellus Gravius wants to speak with you if you haven't started the main quest yet. His dialog is slightly changed if you start the main quest this way, and the decoded letter you get from Caius Cosadus in the main quest is also slightly changed to show that you didn't come by prison ship. \n<br />\n<br />[u]Compatibility\n<br />[/u]This mod should be broadly compatible with most alternate start mods, as it only comes into effect if you haven't started the main quest, otherwise nothing happens. There could, however, be issues with mods that rewrite the main quest enough that it no longer uses the vanilla journal codes."
