Levitation and jumping is no longer a cheat.\n<br />\n<br />Now, if a player is not available for direct attack, enemies will throw stones at him, and magical creatures will cast weak damage spells.\n<br />\n<br />Fixed an engine bug that caused enemies to spontaneously stop fighting.\n<br />\n<br />Fixed an engine bug that sometimes made enemies stand still and do nothing.\n<br />\n<br />Increased the frequency of enemies' attacks so that they are not too passive in combat. You can turn this off in the settings.\n<br />\n<br />Fixed an engine bug when the player became invisible to enemies even at 1% chameleon.\n<br />\n<br />Enemies flee from the battlefield with low health. The higher the level of the enemy, the more difficult it is to make him run with the help of fear spells.\n<br />\n<br />Since combat AI is inextricably linked with stealth, an advanced stealth module has been optionally added. This takes into account many parameters: being in sight, distance to the detector, stats and skills of the detector and the player, noise emitted (weight of boots, weight of items in inventory), invisibility and chameleon effects.\n<br />The difficulty of stealth is configurable.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[youtube]zGBS3ylAipo[/youtube]"
