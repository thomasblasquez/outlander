nexusDescription="[center]\xfeff\xfeff[img]https://i.imgur.com/Cfne9UO.png[/img][/center]\n<br />The next entry in the Fashionwind series; This mod adds cosmetic horns, antlers and cat ears that can be worn without hiding your hair or taking up a helmet slot thanks to a script made by the talented Safebox.\n<br />\n<br />UPDATE 1.1: fixed spelling and grammar special thanks to\xa0Vhira for making the fixed ESP.\n<br />\n<br />You can purchase them from Maelin (bosmer female with antlers) in dirty Muriel's corner club in sadrith mora. (I finally figured out how to do dialogue\xa0so I actually\xa0gave her some unique dialogue and topics,\xa0so talk to her why don't you?)\n<br />\n<br />VERY IMPORTANT NOTES!!!!\n<br />-This mod requires the MWSE Onion layers mod as a framework, which itself requires MWSE, you can get them here:\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50352]Onion - Layered Headwear and Facial Wear[/url]\xfeff and\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/41102]MGE XE[/url]\n<br />\n<br />This mod is entered as part of the may modathon 2022 and is entered as part of the vanity and alteration challenge. (vanity because cosmetic items and alteration because they work through magic (yeah it's kind of a stretch, I'll understand if you don't give me this one)).\xa0\n<br />\n<br />There's not that many items in this mod since it's more of a proof of concept than anything but I plan to add a few more in the future so track this mod if you're interested. besides that if you have any requests for horns I'll hear them out.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />All of my mods free for anyone to use as a resource for what ever you want and free for anyone to translate and host on other sites, as long as you give credit.\n<br />\n<br />If I've made a mistake of some kind, please let me know and I'll do my best to solve it.\n<br />\n<br />you can keep up to date with me and my workings by following me on\xa0[url=https://twitter.com/RVangarr]this terrible website\n<br />\n<br />[/url][center][url=https://twitter.com/RVangarr][img]https://i.imgur.com/OHrHjDA.png[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/ZTat2lG.png[/img]\n<br />[/url][url=https://twitter.com/RVangarr][img]https://i.imgur.com/bp6XUvp.png[/img]\xa0[img]https://i.imgur.com/BtEoUo6.png[/img]\n<br />[/url][img]https://i.imgur.com/wvbiRkz.png[/img][/center][center]\xfeff[/center]"
