Featuring 5 new exploration tracks and 4 new combat tracks, adding extra suspense to some of the most dangerous locations in the game.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[center]\xfeff[youtube]GRKsoHWZt_E[/youtube][/center]\n<br />\n<br />[center][size=3]Inspired by the Hans Zimmer soundtrack for Dune. \"If you're on an alien world, why not make the music sound alien?\"\n<br />[/size][/center]\n<br />[size=3]\xfeff\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[u][b][size=4][center]Details:[/center]\n<br />[/size][/b][/u]\n<br />- The fifth in a series of planned expansions for MUSE that will bring new levels of immersion to your gameplay and dungeon delving. Each mod will have it's own unique mood &amp; tone for all tracks that will help diversify your music experience and prevent the repetition that can occur with the (albeit great) default soundtrack.\n<br />- 5 new exploration tracks that play when entering any of the Daedric shrines in the game\n<br />- 4 new battle tracks that play when in combat with Daedra (Scamps, Daedroth, Golden Saints, etc.)\n<br />- A deadly and mysterious tone that adds extra suspense to every shrine you visit\n<br />- All tracks created using modern production techniques, sample libraries, synths, and plugins\n<br />\xfeff\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b][u][center]Installation:[/center]\n<br />[/u][/b][/size]\n<br />- Requires\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46200]MUSE[/url]\xa0\x61nd all of it's related prerequisites (such as Morrowind Script Extender)\n<br />- Install your selected version using MO2 or your other favorite mod manager, and verify nothing overwrites the files\n<br />- For manual installation, unzip the mod and place the music and MWSE folders into your Morrowind/Data Files directory and overwrite when asked\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][u][size=4][center]Compatibility:[/center][/size][/u][/b]\n<br />- Fully compatible with the other MUSE mods on my\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/1756187?tab=user+files&amp;BH=0]page[/url]\n<br />- Without modification, this mod is incompatible with any other MUSE mods that edit that same cells as this one, or have dynamic music that occurs when fighting this mod's enemy types. i.e. SHoTN, TR, or Solstheim music replacers are probably okay, as are other mods that only edit regional music files, but others may not be. Compatibility with any music mod is possible by dragging the music tracks from those mods into the proper music folder subdirectories contained in this mod.
