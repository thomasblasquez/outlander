nexusDescription="[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/OwTqf4W.png[/img]\xfeff[/center]\n<br />\n<br />A businessman from Cyrodiil came to Morrowind a few years ago and was appalled by how difficult it was to stay up to date with the news there, so he established a similar company to the Black Horse Courier named the Silt Strider Courier with the help of a Hlaalu investor.\xa0The idea is that couriers give recent editions of the newspaper to travelers at silt strider platforms so they have something to read during their trip, and get information about the latest news from Morrowind and the Empire at the same time. It is entirely free of charge, as it is funded by the Empire and House Hlaalu. \n<br />\n<br />There are couriers stationed in: \n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Seyda Neen\n<br />[*]Balmora\n<br />[*]Ald-ruhn\n<br />[*]Vivec\n<br />[*]Suran.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />There are altogether 25 editions of the newspaper currently. (For comparison, Oblivion's Black Horse Courier only had 19) Some of them reflect on the player's actions in the game, others discuss general news and rumors that are independent from the player's meddling.\n<br />\n<br />This mod should be clean, bug-free and compatible with pretty much everything.\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/Nb7mhDt.png[/img]\xfeff\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/Y4OmOyg.png[/img]\xfeff[img]https://i.imgur.com/5t8w0na.png[/img]\xfeff[img]https://i.imgur.com/xrhYyV9.png[/img]\xfeff[img]https://i.imgur.com/b6b3uPj.png[/img][/center]"
