Drop mod directory in\xa0\x44\x61ta Files\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b][size=3]How to survive:[/size][/b]\n<br />By default, with no resistance to common/blight diseases, you have a 30% chance to contract a common disease every 30 seconds. If it feels too punishing for you, you can change it manually in the mod menu to whatever feels right.\n<br />\n<br />Protecting player's character by stacking [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Resist_Common_Disease]resistance to common disease[/url]\xa0\x61nd carrying\xa0[url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Cure_Common_Disease]cure disease potion[/url], becomes crucial\xfeff for your characters health.\n<br />\n<br />Vanilla Morrowind offers a limited selection of items that protect from common/blight disease; however, there are numerous mods on Nexus that do. Some of them (listed below) are truly excellent and you should be using them. Wear gas masks for that sweet Stalkerwind experience!\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3]How it works:[/size][/b][list=1]\n<br />[*]The script searches for locations (cells) whose names contain certain combination of letters (\"tomb\", \"sewer\", \"underworks, \"egg mine\" etc.). You can blacklist specific locations via mod menu if this mod is affecting cells that it shouldn't.\n<br />[*]Once player's character enters such location, a roll is made. If the roll's result is below set chance (30% by default), the character will contract random disease from \"Catchable Diseases\" list. The chance of contracting disease can be changed in mod menu. Also, types of diseases that player's character can contract can be added and removed in mod menu (yes, even ones added by mods).\n<br />[*]Roll is repeated after a delay (30 second by default). The delay can be changed in mod menu.\n<br />[*]However, if character is under influence of Common/Blight Disease Resistance, before disease is contracted, another roll is made. If roll's result is lower than player's characters resistance, disease is resisted.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Swimming modifies the result of the first roll and can therefore increase the chance of contracting the disease, but will not affect chances of resisting the disease.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3]Compatibility:[/size][/b]\n<br />The way this mod works makes it\xa0\x63ompatible with everything, including with locations and diseases added by other mods. Mods that change effects of vanilla diseases will affect diseases that player's character contracts through this mod. If you feel like this mod is affecting location that shouldn't be infectious, you can blacklist it in mod menu. Pay close attention to names of locations that can contain letter combinations like \"tomb\", \"sewer\" etc. Currently, mod will work in both \"Thalas Ancestral Tomb\" and location like \"Momo[u]tomb[/u]ua\" (no such location exists in vanilla, but you get the point).\n<br />\n<br />Note, [u]Infectious Gutters[/u]\xa0\x64oes the same thing as \xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51062]Infectious Sewers - MWSE[/url], and while both mods will work simultaneously without issue, your character will roll for infection much more often. The main difference between the two lies in disease selection. The former gives you full control over which diseases you can catch in sewer environments, while the latter always puts at least swamp fever on the list of \"Catchable Diseases\".\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3]Suggested mods:[/size][/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/52757]Gasmask Sounds and Effects[/url]\xfeff - makes marked helmets emit gas mask breathing sounds and optionally adds resistances to them\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49057]Ashfall[/url]\xfeff - for that amazing survival experience and coughing sounds\xa0\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50280]Protective Helmets[/url]\xa0\xfeff- automatically adds Common Disease Protection to helmets\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51610]Fashionwind - MWSE Masks and Facewraps[/url]\xa0- adds masks and dwemer gas masks\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47331]FMI - Disease Descriptions[/url]\xfeff\xa0- without this mod NPCs will lie to you\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49919]Deadly Diseases[/url]\xa0- hardcore,\xa0\x61mirite?\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/52419]Magnitude of a Cure[/url]\xfeff - am I?!\xfeff\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48435]Unto Dust[/url]\xa0- disease ridden particles that you inhale\xfeff become visible\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[center]\n<br />\xfeff[/center][center][/center][center][i]Released as a part of[/i][/center][center][img]https://i.imgur.com/iIvZdHG.png[/img]\xfeff\n<br />[b][size=3]Disclaimer:[/size][/b][/center][center]This mod is an expansion of previously released mod called\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51062]Infectious Sewers - MWSE[/url].
