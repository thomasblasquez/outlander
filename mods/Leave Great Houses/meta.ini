nexusDescription="[font=Arial][size=6]Summary\n<br />[/size]\n<br />In my first playthrough of Morrowind, I joined House Hlaalu without really realizing\xa0the consequences of my actions. Since I was a battle-mage, I had little want nor need to invest in the skills needed to advance in their ranks. Since Hlaalu is most likely the first House players will encounter throughout\xa0their journey through Vvardenfell, I assume I am not alone in my experience.\n<br />\n<br />This mod is for people in that position: Players who joined a house early on, and then realized\xa0that house would not suit their character. The developers obviously wanted players to only choose one house, so I wanted to keep that aspect while giving some leeway.\xa0So you can only leave a house if you are a hireling and once you leave a certain house you cannot join back.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]Usage[/size][/font]\n<br />\n<br />Copy one of the esps into the data files folder and enable it.\n<br />\n<br />To leave house redoran, talk to Neminda and choose \"join House Redoran\" out of the dialogue options, then choose \"leave House Redoran\".\n<br />\n<br />To leave house hlaalu,\xa0talk to Nileno Dorvayn and choose \"House Hlaalu\" out of the dialogue options, then choose \"leave House Hlaalu\".\n<br />\n<br />To leave house telvanni,\xa0talk to any Telvanni Mouth and choose \"join House Telvanni\" out of the dialogue options, then choose \"leave House Telvanni\".\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[font=Arial][size=5]Requirements\n<br />[/size][/font]\n<br />The latest version of OpenMW OR Morrowind Code Patch with \"Allow Faction Leaving\" enabled is required.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[font=Arial][size=5]Misc[/size][size=2]\n<br />[/size][/font][size=2]\n<br />[/size][size=3]If [/size]you are permanently expelled from House Redoran, and if you didn't get the \"leave House Redoran\" topic in the dialogue box before getting expelled, then you cannot leave House Redoran.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />This mod also makes it so you can hear the rules of House Hlaalu before joining them.\n<br />\n<br />IMPORTANT - Leaving a House in a middle of a quest for that house may result in a variety of glitches, use at your own risk."
