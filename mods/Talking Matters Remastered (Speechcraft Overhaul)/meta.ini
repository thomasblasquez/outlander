This version expands on their original concept somewhat, with the addition of context based answers and messages (only for if you are friends or not currently), extended tweakability, a rebalancing, and many bug fixes where there was a risk for warnings, crashes, or unintended behaviors.\n<br />\n<br />A great shoutout to sofiaaq for all the great ideas and for the foundation of the code. I hope I have been able to make the mod justice with the work I have added to it[/quote][/left][/size][/font][font=Tahoma][u]\n<br />\n<br />[/u][size=6][left][font=Arial][size=3][u][b]Description &amp; Features[/b][/u][/size][/font][/left][/size][font=Arial][size=3]Talking Matters Remastered is a set of modules (each one can be turned on and off as you please) aimed at making talking to NPCs more immersive and interesting, and to make Speechcraft both a more important and fun to use skill, and a less frustrating one to train and use through a play through.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />The mod is highly tweakable, but provides a basic (fairly forgiving in my opinion) balancing.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#e69138][b][u]1. Charisma to hold someone's attention - Limited topics (per day)\n<br />[/u][/b][/color]\n<br />Each time you enter a dialogue with someone, you will have a limited set of topics you can ask about before they grow tired of you and ask you to leave them alone. Force yourself on them more than so, and they will start to dislike you.\n<br />\n<br />The amount of topics is reset each day, and the amount you get is determined by your speechcraft level, how talkative they are (based on both their\xa0 speechcraft level and their class), the NPCs disposition, if you belong to the same faction, if you are colleagues (have the same class), your fatigue level, and if they consider you a friend or not. There is ample feedback on when a character don't want to talk to you any longer.\n<br />\n<br />Whenever an NPC has something interesting to say (a journal entry), or something that might require an answer (a dialogue choice), the mod won't count down your topics, but might instead even add a few extra as the NPC clearly has something they want to say to you.\n<br />[u]\n<br />\n<br />[/u][color=#e69138][b][u]2. NPCs take offense - A limit on how many failed persuasions are allowed (per day)\n<br />[/u][/b][/color]\n<br />NPCs can take offense from your insistent attempts of persuasion. After a (tweakable) amount of failed attempts at persuasion, they will be offended, and refuse to talk to you and refuse you services for the rest of the day. Successful persuasion on the other hand gives you more topics that you can ask.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#e69138][b][u]3. Talking takes time\n<br />[/u][/b][/color]\n<br />Time will advance during dialogues with a (tweakable) amount of minutes per topic. The time passed will be advanced when you close the Dialog Menu, and fatigue will be restored at a rate slightly smaller than plain waiting.\xa0\n<br />[u]\n<br />\n<br />[/u][color=#e69138][b][u]4. Asking questions is a crucial skill for a good listener - Chance for disposition gain when talking\n<br />[/u][/b][/color]\n<br />There is a chance of gaining someone's trust by talking to them. A random chance based on the player's speechcraft and luck can increase the NPCs disposition towards you with maximum 1pt per topic.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#e69138][b][u]5.[/u][/b][/color][/size][/font][/font][font=Tahoma][font=Arial][size=3][color=#e69138][b][u]\xa0Train your speechcraft from...\xa0 Speaking!\n<br />[/u][/b][/color]\n<br />Every new topic chosen will train your speechcraft a little, helping you grow more wellspoken without having to suceed in persuasions.\xa0[/size][/font][/font]\n<br />[font=Tahoma][font=Arial][size=3]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#e69138][b][u]6. Exclude NPCs you don't want affected by the mod through a blacklist\n<br />[/u][/b][/color]\n<br />If you play with a companion, you might want to blacklist them to not get limited topics with them every day. \n<br />\n<br />As a default configuration, I added all the essential NPCs to the blacklist as I haven't tested a full playthrough and don't know how it affects certain aspects of both immersion and gameplay. You can easily remove these if you want to, and there is a reset button to add them all back, so experiment as you want to during your playthrough.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[u][b]Installation and removal[/b][/u][/size][/font][font=Arial][size=3]\n<br />\n<br />[/size][/font][/font][list]\n<br />[*][font=Arial][size=3]This is a pluginless MWSE mod, and as such neither require or include any .esp.

They do the same thing, so they would probably be the only incompatible mod as far as I know.\n<br />[*]Talking Matters Remastered should be compatible with most other mods, unless they do something very similar.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[u][b]Recommended mods together with this one[/b]\n<br />[/u]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]I highly recommend using [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46071]UI expansion[/url]\xfeff\xa0\x66or seeing what you have already asked of people, and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/36873]Better Dialogue Font[/url]\xfeff for some crisp visuals.\n<br />[*]The mod works really well together with the fantastic\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49086]Silver Tongue[/url]\xfeff\xa0to bring even more immersion and value to Speechcraft.\xa0\n<br />[*]And last but absolutely not least, I prefer playing with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51427]Real Disposition[/url]\xfeff to close the circle of making Speechcraft interesting through an entire playthrough. Personally I play on the light setting they provide, but the mod works flawlessly with all options.\n<br />[*]I also think that it might be worth checking out the dialogue only [url=http://lgnpc.org/dialogue-only]Less Generic NPCs[/url]\xfeff (LGNPC). It adds more unique dialogue to a variety of characters that might make it more interesting to talk further with some. I have not tried the quest ones, but heard good things about them too.\n<br />[/list][/size][/font][font=Arial][size=3]\n<br />\n<br />[font=Arial][size=3][u][b]Future plans\n<br />[/b][/u][/size][/font][/size][/font]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][font=Arial][size=3]More context sensitive answers depending on NPC and Player race, class, faction etc. and NPCs current disposition.[/size][/font]\n<br />[*][font=Arial][size=3]Investigate OpenMW port.[/size][/font]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[font=Arial][size=3][u][b]Credits[/b]\n<br />[/u]\n<br />[url=https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/sofiaaq?gameId=100]sofiaaq[/url]\xa0\x66or writing the orginial mod.\n<br />The Morrowind modding community for helping out when needed, especial shoutout to Storm Atronach, Safeicus Boxius, Greatness7 and NullCascade.\n<br />Bethesda for our beloved Morrowind.\n<br />Big thanks to my (anonymous) buddy who drew the mod image :)[/size][/font][font=Tahoma]\n<br />[/font]"
