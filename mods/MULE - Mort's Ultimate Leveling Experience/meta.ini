nexusDescription="Mort's Ultimate Leveling Experience [MULE]\n<br />by mort\n<br />Version 2.1\n<br />\n<br />A fully customizable leveling mod that removes the level-up screen entirely.\xa0Never worry about min/maxing skill ups ever again. The functionality of GCD/MADD, but fully customizable and conflict-free. Play how you want, and leave leveling to the MULE.\n<br />\n<br />About:\n<br />With this mod, you will never see a levelup screen. You won't have to min/max to make sure you're gaining health properly, or getting enough strength per level. Instead, progress in skills gives you progress towards attribute gains.\n<br />\n<br />Similar to GCD, except not nearly as punishing and (hopefully) not nearly as buggy.\n<br />\n<br />By default, major and minor skills give 1 of their favored attribute per level.\n<br />\n<br />Misc skills give 0.5, but only after they are at 30 or above (otherwise you could just spam training and get a ton of attributes from your misc skills).\n<br />\n<br />Misc skills also give progress towards level. 3 misc skills give one level point (As in vanilla, 10 are required to level. This is one of the few unchangeable values).\n<br />\n<br />Luck is gained 1 per level.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />Health gain is either vanilla, or my preferred method of 5 per level, and gain 2 health per endurance gained.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />There is a fairly robust Mod Configuration Menu included.\xa0\n<br />In that you have the option to:\n<br />-Change level thresholds for attribute gain\n<br />-Change amount of attribute gain\n<br />-Modify gains from major/minor/misc\n<br />-Revert health gains to vanilla\n<br />\n<br />Suggested Mod:\n<br />MWSE State based health by Necrolesian\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48133]https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48133[/url]\n<br />\n<br />Updates:\n<br />v2.1\n<br />-Added optional exp rate modifiers to speed up / slow down leveling of major/misc/minor skills\n<br />-Added optional magicka per willpower skill gain\n<br />-Added warning for MCP feature so people stop getting confused \n<br />-Converted skills per level to use GMST value\n<br />\n<br />v2.0\n<br />-Added optional skill decay\n<br />-Compatible with any mods that change attributes of skills (not hardcoded anymore!)\n<br />-Bugfixes\n<br />\n<br />v1.7\n<br />-Now includes levelup messages\n<br />-More difficult default leveling (it was a bit *too* easy)\n<br />\n<br />v1.6\n<br />-Now fixes -1 levelup bug\n<br />\n<br />v1.5\n<br />-You can now alter the flat rate HP system! Both flat HP per level and HP per endurance are now changeable\n<br />-Fixed return potentially breaking other MWSE mods using skillup event\n<br />-Now using HP GMST instead of 0.1 for vanilla leveling\n<br />\n<br />v1.4\n<br />-0 misc to level now correctly doesn't increment levelup progress\n<br />\n<br />v1.3\n<br />-Fixed a different misc leveling bug\n<br />\n<br />v1.2\n<br />-Fixed misc level bug\n<br />\n<br />v1.1\n<br />-More customizable options\n<br />-Fixed UI bug\n<br />-Fixed long blade bug\n<br />\n<br />Requirements:\n<br />-MGEXE\n<br />-MWSE-lua beta branch (available here: https://nullcascade.com/mwse/mwse-dev.zip )\n<br />-OpenMW is not supported\n<br />\n<br />Installation:\n<br />-Drag and drop data files folder, merge if asked.\n<br />\n<br />Uninstallation:\n<br />-Remove or rename the main.lua file.
