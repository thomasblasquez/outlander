nexusDescription="[i]\"When the sun rises near one of the constellations, it is that constellation's season. Each constellation has a Season of approximately one month.\" -Ffoulke, The Firmament\n<br />[/i]Window to Aetherius replaces the night sky with one that changes as the game year progresses (thanks to Lua script by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/64030]@Greatness7[/url]\xfeff ). On day one of every month, the prime constellation will be visible on the eastern horizon and fades away to the next month's constellation as the month progresses. The mod features a fully hand-painted texture including nebulae and stars, with the positions of the constellations derived from the star map included in The Elder Scrolls Adventures Redguard.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />This mod was a labour of love that I waited nine years to be possible. I spent two months painstakingly painting the texture in Photoshop with purpose-made custom brushes. As of release, there is nothing out there for Morrowind like it. I hope you all enjoy it!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />A note: since it will take an entire ingame year for the entire sky to be visible, most players will probably not see the whole sky over a playthrough. Because of this, I recommend using some mods which increase the ingame time a playthrough will take. Here are some suggestions:\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49057]Ashfall[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51396]Time Consumer[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48287]Dynamic Timescale\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/53024]Spawn on a Certain Day[/url]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />REQUIRES: MWSE Lua\n<br />\n<br />OpenMw may be possible in the future once the sky is de-hardcoded or Lua support improves but afaik it is not possible right now."
