nexusDescription="Illuminated Order Improved\n<br />by mort\n<br />v3.0\n<br />\n<br />Bugfixes and making it OpenMW Compatible. Adds alternate lore-friendly version.\n<br />\n<br />Join a cult of necromancers, wizards, vampires, and adventurers, and become a lich.\n<br />\n<br />Original Mod (Not Required to download)\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42658]Original Mod\n<br />\n<br />[/url]Compatible Mods\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49593]Fire Particle Effect\n<br />[/url]\n<br />[Changes]\n<br />[3.0]\n<br />Fixed the trial script (for real this time)\n<br />Additional dialogue fixes\n<br />Removed the Red Mountain Edits (Tower of Semuta is renamed and moved south of Tel Branora)\n<br />The Ritual is now impossible to fail and doesn't require you to sacrifice seven daedric artifacts\n<br />\n<br />No longer supporting the non-lore friendly version\n<br />\n<br />[2.0]\n<br />I went through it with mwedit and fixed every buggy script. One of the late encounters just straight up didn't work with openmw so I changed that too.\n<br />\n<br />For the lore-friendly version I removed a south park reference, some weirdly named places/items, and a certain origin story that doesn't really fit.\n<br />Has the same fixes as the other version.\n<br />\n<br />The other mod had AI flee tweaks and alternate bloodmoon compatibility.\n<br />The BM compatibility is now baked in. The AI flee tweaks were some GMST edits better left for other mods.\n<br />\n<br />[Install]\n<br />drag and drop into data files\n<br />check box\n<br />\n<br />[Credits]\n<br />Me - changes\n<br />C.J. DeVito &amp; LDones - the whole damn mod\n<br />\n<br />[Permissions]\n<br />See other readme included, I add no additional provisions to my changes"
