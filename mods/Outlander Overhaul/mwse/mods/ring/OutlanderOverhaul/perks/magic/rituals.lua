Illusion Rituals
- Illusory Copy: 
    Creates an illusory copy of the caster that can distract enemies. Copy does not deal damage. Copy lasts until it is destroyed.
    - Required items: a filled Soul Gem
    - Required spell effects: Chameleon, Sanctuary, Sound
    - Steps:
        1. Place a filled soul gem on the ground.
        2. Cast the spell on the soul gem.
        3. Pick the soul gem back up and equip it to summon the copy.
    - Book text:
        "The ritual of Illusory Copy allows the caster to create a temporary illusion of themselves, which can be used to distract enemies or draw their
        fire. The illusion is not capable of dealing damage, but it can serve as a useful diversion in combat situations. Unlike summoned creatures, this
        copy does not expire after a certain time, but rather lasts until it is destroyed. 
        To perform the ritual, an illusionist must first obtain a soul gem filled with a soul. The projection of the caster is not dependent on the strength
        of the trapped soul. Then, the caster must prepare a spell that combines the effects of Chameleon, Sanctuary, and Sound. The magnitude of these effects
        is not important, nor is the duration. This spell is then cast on the soul gem, which serves as a focus for the illusion. Using the soul gem will
        summon the Illusory Copy, which will follow the caster and attack their enemies, though their attacks will pass right through them. The illusion
        will remain active until it is killed."

- Zone of Safety:
    Creates a totem that provides a protective area of about 1000 units around it when placed. Allied creatures within the area are rallied
    and gain Sanctuary, while enemies are given the Demoralize, Blind, and Sound debuffs. The totem lasts for 60 seconds total, but can be
    picked up and placed again to pause the timer.
    - Required items: Fire wood and an empty soul gem
    - Required spell effects: Rally (Humanoid or Creature), Sanctuary, Demoralize, Blind, and Sound
    - Steps:
        1. Craft the fire wood into a totem and place it on the ground.
        2. Add an empty soul gem to the totem.
        3. Cast the spell on the totem
        4. Activate the totem to pick up the totem, then place it again to activate the protective area.
    - Book text:
        "The Zone of Safety ritual allows the caster to create a protective totem that creates a warding area.
        The totem can be placed on the ground, and it will create a protective zone around it. Allies within this zone will be rallied and gain Sanctuary,
        while enemies will be demoralized, blinded, and deafened. The totem has enough charge to last for one minute, but it can be picked up to save its
        remaining charge.
        To perform the ritual, the caster must first craft firewood into a totem. Then, an empty soul gem must be added to the totem. Finally, a spell
        combining the effects of Rally (Humanoid or Creature), Sanctuary, Demoralize, Blind, and Sound must be cast on the totem. the duration and magnitude
        of these effects are not relevant. Once activated, the totem will provide protection for allies and debilitate enemies within its area of effect."
