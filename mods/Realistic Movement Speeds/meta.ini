nexusDescription="[center][size=5][b]Realistic Movement Speeds[/b][/size]\n<br />[size=4][b]By: OperatorJack[/b][/size][/center]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b]Description[/b][/size]\n<br />This mod uses MWSE Lua to modify movement speeds when strafing or backpedalling so that they are more realistic. NPCs and player alike will no longer be able to fire volleys of arrows while running backwards to safety. Movement direction is now tactically important.\n<br />\xa0\n<br />If you are strafing (moving to the left or right while facing forward), then movement speed will be decreased by 20% in addition to the movement penalty that Vanilla MW has.\xa0\n<br />If you are backpedalling (walking backwards while looking forwards), then movement speed will be decreased by 40%.\n<br />\n<br />These changes automatically apply to the player and any NPCs / Creatures (modded or vanilla) without using a plugin or altering your savegame. To expand on the effects to strafing, Vanilla MW already has strafing set to be 75% of regular movement speed. This mod will decrease that reduced movement speed by an additional 20%.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />As of version 1.1, you can configure the percentage multiplier using the in-game MCM settings. Percentages shown represent the multiplier for the speed type. To increase the slowing effect, decrease the percentages. This will multiply the speed by a lower multiplier, effectively lowering the speed.\n<br />\n<br />This mod IS NOT compatible with OpenMW, at least until support for MWSE mods is added.\n<br />\n<br />[spoiler]\n<br />[size=4][b]Requirements[/b][/size]\n<br />- Morrowind\n<br />- MGE XE 0.10.1\n<br />- MWSE 2.1+\n<br />This mod requires the most recently nightly build of MWSE.
