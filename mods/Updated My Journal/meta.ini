nexusDescription="[b]Introduction\n<br />[/b]This mod simply lets you write new journal entries with whatever text you want. This has no gameplay value, this is purely a roleplaying tool.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Installation\n<br />[/b]Install with your favorite mod manager. If you want to install it manually, just drop the MWSE folder inside Data Files.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Usage[/b]\n<br />When in the journal menu, press ALT+Enter to open the text editor. Once you've written what you want press ALT+Enter again to save: it will close the journal and give you a notification. You can also press ESC to cancel instead.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Important\n<br />[/b]There's a few things to be aware of when using this mod.\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Normally Morrowind fetches a journal entry's text from plugin data. Here, the text will be baked in your save file. It shouldn't be too much of an issue, but if you play for a very long time and write lots of text it can add up.\n<br />[*]Once added an entry can't be deleted.\n<br />[*]The text editor accepts a maximum of 450 characters. This should be a safe enough margin to make sure the text fits on journal pages.\n<br />[*]Once added an entry can't be modified either. You'll need\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46756?tab=description]Journal Search and Edit[/url]\xa0\x66or that. It also lets you edit vanilla journal entries to make them fit your character more.\n<br />[*]If you write two entries with the [b]exact same text[/b]\xfeff, they'll both appear in the journal but will internally be considered one. If you modify one with the above mod you'll modify both. Not sure why you would want to do this but eh.\n<br />[/list]"
