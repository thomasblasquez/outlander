nexusDescription="[u][size=5][center]Berandas Overhaul\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/637816299375820830/710457131861803098/OwTqf4W.png[/img][/center][/size][/u]\n<br />[u]Description[/u]\n<br />\n<br />This mod overhauls and slightly expands the old Dunmer fortress Berandas near Gnisis. Daedra have claimed Berandas, but other than the few roaming Daedra themselves there is not much evidence of the corruption. With this mod, old daedric structures have risen from the deep to transform the fortress into a proper daedric stronghold.\n<br />\n<br />The mod adds daedric structures to the Berandas exterior cell and to the first two levels of the interior. It also makes some slight changes to their layouts. The last cell, the underground, has been redone from scratch. There are also two new, additional cells, although one of them is really tiny. The other one not so much. As of Version 2.1 there are also some clues as to what might be the cause of the daedric corruption as well as a tiny quest to go along with them. \n<br />\n<br />Note that there are more daedric creatures walking the old corridors and caverns than in vanilla, so it has gotten a little harder to reach those boots. If your character can handle one or two golden saints, you should be fine, though. \n<br />\n<br />[u]Version History[/u]\n<br />\n<br />[i]Version 2.1[/i]: Added a few notes and a journal for you to find that might offer clues into what might have caused the daedric corruption that has befallen Berandas. There is also a tiny, tiny quest and some new dialogue to go along with those clues. You have to find the hidden journal to activate the quest.    \n<br />\n<br />Also, I have fixed the lava bubbles in the final chamber, and the stolen key you can find now opens the hidden chest instead of one of the regular ones , thus granting you a better reward. \n<br />\n<br />[i]Version 2.0[/i]: Added more details throughout and redid the final chamber using OAAB_Data, hopefully making it look more epic. Thus, [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49042]OAAB_Data[/url] is now required. Plus, fixed some minor things, deleted some parts that I didn't like anymore, and cleaned the mod again, so there shouldn't be any more issues. \n<br />\n<br />[u]Requirements[/u]\n<br />\n<br />Morrowind\n<br />\n<br />[u]Background[/u]\n<br />\n<br />I wanted to enter a mod for May Modathon Month and I've always thought that Berandas was a little lacklustre. So I figured I'd try to change that. \n<br />\n<br />[u]Recommended Mods\n<br />\n<br />[/u]I highly recommend using [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45424]Better Waterfalls[/url] by Melchior Dahrk.
