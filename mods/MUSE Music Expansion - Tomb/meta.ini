Each mod will have it's own unique mood &amp; tone for all tracks that will help diversify your music experience and prevent the repetition that can occur with the (albeit great) default soundtrack.\n<br />- 5 new exploration tracks that play when entering any of the ancestral tombs in the game\n<br />- 4 new battle tracks that play when in combat with remnants of the dead (Skeletons, Ancestor ghosts, Bonewalkers, etc.)\n<br />- Includes an optional GOTY version that sets the music to also be played in the few crypts in Tribunal and in the barrows of Solstheim\n<br />- A creeping and horrific tone that makes stepping into each tomb a more unsettling experience\n<br />- All tracks created using modern production techniques, sample libraries, synths, and plugins\n<br />\xfeff\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\xfeff\n<br />[size=4][b][u][center]Installation:[/center][/u][/b][/size]\n<br />- Requires [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46200]MUSE[/url] and all of it's related prerequisites (such as Morrowind Script Extender)\n<br />- Select either the Vanilla only version, [b]or[/b] the GOTY version\n<br />- Install your selected version using MO2 or your other favorite mod manager, and verify nothing overwrites the files\n<br />- For manual installation, unzip the mod and place the music and MWSE folders into your Morrowind/Data Files directory and overwrite when asked\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][u][size=4][center]Compatibility:[/center][/size][/u][/b]\n<br />- Fully compatible with the other MUSE mods on my [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/1756187?tab=user+files&amp;BH=0]page[/url]\n<br />- Without modification, this mod is incompatible with any other MUSE mods that edit that same cells as this one, or have dynamic music that occurs when fighting this mod's enemy types. i.e. SHoTN, TR, or Solstheim music replacers are probably okay, as are other mods that only edit regional music files, but others may not be. Compatibility with any music mod is possible by dragging the music tracks from those mods into the proper music folder subdirectories contained in this mod.
