This was one of the world's first known board games. It was played in ancient Mesopotamia and has since seen somewhat of a revival through the work of archaeologists and museum curators. (See [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Game_of_Ur]Wikipedia article[/url].)\n<br />\n<br />I was going to try creating some basic assets for the board and pieces, but fortunately, LordBerandas beat me to it in 2017 with the mod \"[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44945]The Royal Game of Ur[/url]\", which has assets, a book of rules, and some item placement, but no gameplay. LordBerandas gave me permission to derive from this work. I have avoided to the extent possible redistributing the assets of the mod, choosing to keep it as a requirement so that this mod serves as a complement. The only asset included here is a fixed version of the board mesh, which had a display issue in OpenMW.\n<br />\n<br />The game includes a full AI to play against. It is not designed for two multiplayer users.\n<br />\n<br />Be sure to check out my other minigame mods, [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/52081]Thirteen Telvanni[/url] and\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/52093]Nine-holes[/url], which nicely complement the locations of this game.\n<br />\n<br />[i]Neither MWSE nor OpenMW are required. This mod uses only native Morrowind scripting.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />[b][i]Assets from the mod [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44945]The Royal Game of Ur[/url] are required (loading the .esp is optional).[/i][/b]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][b][size=4]How to Play[/size][/b][/center]\n<br />This game is simple but has a lot of depth to master, which is perhaps why it proved so popular in the ancient world.\n<br />\n<br />The game is for two players. Its basic game loop consists of a dice roll and moving one figure, with a goal of adding all figures to the board and moving them to the end. It's an early form of Backgammon. In the [i]Morrowind[/i] version, one side plays as the [b]Dwemer[/b] and the other as the [b]Automatons[/b].\n<br />\n<br />Shown below is a diagram of each player's route that they move their figures, as well as the \"ellipses\" mentioned later marked with a star symbol. The green row is a shared \"combat row\".\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/RRuMANn.png[/img][/center]\xfeff\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Four dice are rolled, each one adding either 1 or 0 to the total. Therefore, the probabilities of rolls are:\n<br />[/list]   \xfeff   [b]\xfeffRoll\xa0\x30[/b] \x2014 1/16th\xa0 (least common)\n<br />\xfeff   \xfeff[b]   \xfeffRoll\xa0\xfeff\x31[/b] \x2014 1/4th\n<br />   \xfeff[b]   \xfeffRoll\xa0\xfeff\x32[/b] \x2014 3/8th\xa0 (most common)\n<br />   \xfeff[b]   \xfeffRoll\xa0\xfeff\x33[/b] \x2014 1/4th\n<br />   \xfeff[b]   \xfeff\xfeffRoll\xa0\x34[/b] \x2014 1/16th\xa0 (least common)\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]On a player's turn, they may either add a figure to the board from their stack or move a figure already placed. In either case, figures advance as many squares as the dice roll value.\n<br />[*]The first four spaces closest to the player are not shared with the opponent. After the fourth square, figures turn and enter the shared combat row that goes along the length of the board. The final two spaces once again split off toward the player's side, and figures are safe from capture there.\n<br />[*]A player's figures cannot share a square. If an opponent's figure is in the way on the shared combat row, the opponent's figure is sent back to their stack.\n<br />[*]To be removed from the board, you have to roll the exact number of spaces needed to reach one space past the final square.\n<br />[*]The first player to remove all their figures from the board wins.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b]Extra rules:[/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]On the fourth, eighth, and fourteenth squares of each player's track, there is an ellipse shape. Landing on the ellipse allows another turn. This can be repeated several times in a row if lucky.\n<br />[*]A figure on the shared ellipse on the eighth square is safe from capture.\n<br />[*]In this mod, betting is available before starting the game. The reward for winning is double the bet.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[center][size=4]Watch this 25-minute video to see the full game from start to finish, along with an explanation of the rules and the game's history. Irving Finkel is a museum curator whose work helped decipher the original rules, as used in this mod.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[youtube]WZskjLq040I[/youtube][/center][b][size=4][center]\n<br />\n<br />Game of Ur Locations[/center][/size][/b]\n<br />Look for this game among the collections of Dwemer enthusiasts and wizards. There are four playable boards, not counting the miscellaneous items hand-placed by LordBerandas' mod (these are not playable).\n<br />\n<br />[b]Tel Fyr[/b], Corprusarium Bowels\n<br />Relevant NPC:   \xfeffYagrum Bagarn\n<br />Bet:   \xfeff   \xfeff   \xfeffnone\n<br />\n<br />[b]Balmora[/b], Guild of Fighters\n<br />Challenger:   \xfeffHasphat Antabolis\n<br />Bet:   \xfeff   \xfeff   \xfeff\x32\x35\n<br />\n<br />[b]Vivec[/b], Guild of Mages\n<br />Challenger:   \xfeffTrebonius Artorius\n<br />Bet:   \xfeff   \xfeff   \xfeff\x35\x30\n<br />[u]Note[/u]:   \xfeff   \xfeff\x42\x65tting only for Mages Guild members\n<br />\n<br />[b]Gnisis[/b], Arvs-Drelen\n<br />Challenger:   \xfeff\x42\x61ladas Demnevanni\n<br />Bet:   \xfeff   \xfeff   \xfeff\x31\x30\x30\n<br />[u]Note[/u]:   \xfeff   \xfeffRequires 60+ disposition\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][size=4][b]Optional Add-on: Voice Expansion[/b][/size][/center]\n<br />Thanks to [url=https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Von%20Django/about-me]Von Django[/url], I have added 23 voice lines to the characters who play against you as an optional add-on. These sound just like the default Imperial and Dunmer voices, increasing the immersion of playing a board game. Hasphat Antabolis and Trebonius Artorius share the same 12 lines. Baladas Demnevanni has his own 11 lines, plus uses one vanilla line.\n<br />\n<br />For those interested, the types of voice lines are:[list]\n<br />[*]They roll the dice\n<br />[*]They roll a 0\n<br />[*]Early game\n<br />[*]Mid game\n<br />[*]Close game\n<br />[*]End game\n<br />[*]They lose a piece\n<br />[*]They capture your piece\n<br />[*]They are losing\n<br />[*]They are winning\n<br />[*]They lose the game\n<br />[*]They win the game\n<br />[/list]These lines do not trigger every time for repetitive actions like rolling the dice, so as to not make the voices annoying.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][size=4][b]Compatibility[/b][/size][/center]\n<br />If there is an incompatible mod, please leave a comment, and I will consider making a patch.\n<br />\n<br />Compatible out of the box:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49231]Beautiful Cities of Morrowind (BCOM)[/url]\xfeff\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Patches available in optional files:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49738]The Corprusarium Experience[/url]\xfeff\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4][center]Credits[/center][/size][/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][url=https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/LordBerandas]LordBerandas[/url]\xfeff\xa0\x2014 assets and book of rules from [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44945]The Royal Game of Ur[/url]\xfeff mod (permission granted via Discord)\xfeff\n<br />[*][url=https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Von%20Django]Von Django[/url]\xfeff\xa0\x2014 voices for optional add-on\n<br />[*][url=https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/CrossProjectCoordination]Tamriel_Data team[/url]\xfeff\xfeff \x2014 dice roll sound and flat table; these are included in the mod so that Tamriel_Data is not a requirement\n<br />[*][url=https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Greatness7]Greatness7[/url]\xa0\x2014 fixes to game board mesh\xfeff\n<br />[*]Kvikvendi \x2014 public domain board diagram on this mod page\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b][center]My Other Mods[/center][/b][/size]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/52120/][/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/53820/][/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/56558]Animal Articulation - Balmora Temple Quests[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/53820/]Moving Minecarts[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/52120/]Vivec Lighthouse Keeper - Questline[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/52093]Nine-holes\xfeff[/url]\xfeff\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/52081]Thirteen Telvanni - a Dunmer Card Game[/url]\xfeff\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/52034]Writer of the Third Era[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50381]Quick Character Creation[/url]\xfeff\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48228]Preview Warning for Tamriel Rebuilt (and Building Your Own TR_Preview)\xfeff[/url]\n<br />[/list]"
