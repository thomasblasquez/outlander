nexusDescription="[u][b][size=4]Description[/size][/b][/u]\n<br />Rather than transforming each night, werewolf PCs will transform only on some nights. Every night, you will be warned at 7 PM (two hours before a potential transformation) that night is approaching. If there will be a transformation, then a second warning will come at 8 PM as a last warning. The transformation may be every third night, or randomly chosen between 1 and 5 days (allowing the possibility of back-to-back transformations).\n<br />\n<br />[u][b][size=4]Intent[/size][/b][/u]\n<br />I wanted to add tension to being a werewolf, and make the curse be more of a liability. Deciding to go into town late is now a gamble, rather than certainly a bad decision. This also sort of weakens the value of being a werewolf, which felt highly beneficial. This opens the possibility of playing as a werewolf longer term to be more interesting.\n<br />\n<br />[u][b][size=4]Compatibility[/size][/b][/u]\n<br />This mod affects WereChangeScript, which tracks the state of the PC as a werewolf, werewolf mods which alter the actual transformation may conflict. Mods to the werewolf hunger mechanic may also cause a conflict if they need to change this script. This does NOT change the mechanism by which Sanies Lupinus afflicts the player, nor does it delay the first transformation.\n<br />\n<br />[u][b][size=4]Requirements[/size][/b][/u]\n<br />This only requires the Bloodmoon expansion.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Both new and old games should be fine for use with this mod.[/b]\xa0If used with an old save, your first transformation will be the next night and will not have a warning, but the script will snap in place just fine (aside from Morrowind warning you that WereChangeScript has been altered- you can ignore this warning)."
