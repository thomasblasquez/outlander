nexusDescription="[center][size=6][b]Useful Maps and Guides[/b][/size][/center]\n<br />[center][size=4]by Lucevar\n<br />v1.0\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://imgur.com/QCrTidp.png[/img]\xfeff[/size][/center]\n<br />Vanilla Morrowind includes 5 guides to various cities and regions, with a map at the top of each one and then detailed information about the location.\n<br />The problem is that once you're familiar with the game's geography, there's just not much reason to buy one or even look at it.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />This mod adds a small incentive to do so, by scripting the guides to add the cities marked on the guide maps to your world map when you read them. It will also add a small number of relevant geographical or political topics (eg \"House Redoran\", \"Ald'ruhn\", and \"Maar Gan\" when reading the Guide to Ald'ruhn scroll).\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[b]Compatibility[/b]\n<br />===============\n<br />Should work in either OpenMW or the vanilla/MWSE engine. I've only tested it on vanilla/MWSE though.\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Anything that replaces the book art of the guides by just replacing the art file should be compatible.\n<br />[*]Anything that replaces the book art of the guides by changing the guide text (eg to point to a different art file) will be incompatible. You should use tes3merge to generate a merged objects file to resolve the conflict.\xa0\n<br />[*]Anything that replaces the model of the scroll should be compatible.\n<br />[*]Anything that replaces the model of the guides by pointing it at a different model will be incompatible. You should use tes3merge to generate a merged objects file to resolve the conflict.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b]Suggested Mods[/b]\n<br />===============\n<br />Mods that make the guides more beautiful (use tes3merge!)\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][url=https://mw.modhistory.com/download--3101]\"Guide to...\"[/url]\xfeff replacer by Stalker\n<br />[*][url=https://mw.modhistory.com/download-56-6041]Guide Maps[/url]\xfeff by Connary - depends on the STA Guides To replacer above\n<br />[/list]And some mods that make getting lost easier/more dangerous (and maps more useful):\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51126]Immersive Compass[/url]\xfeff by Safebox, Remiros &amp; Lucevar\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48455]Map &amp; Compass[/url]\xfeff by JaceyS - the map markers won't show up, but the dialogue topics will, and it's a cool mod so I had to mention it\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49057]Ashfall[/url]\xfeff by Merlord\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51081]Achievement Framework[/url]\xfeff by Safebox if you want to use the Achievements addon\n<br />[/list][b]Credits[/b]\n<br />================\n<br />Thanks to Greatness7, Eddie5, Pikachuno, and ohayo for scripting help.\n<br />Thanks to Safebox for making the Achievements addon"
