In addition to being a visual overhaul, this mod adds many new quests, dialogue, and scripted events. This mod was built on months of research into what a logical expansion of Vos would consist of within the context of the original game as well as themes for new quests and dialogue. Many of the new quests focus on Telvanni characters, but there is plenty to do for other players as well.\n<br />\n<br />Future updates will expand the area covered by this mod to the rest of the Grazelands region. The mod also includes a patched version of Remiros' Groundcover mod which fixes a few placement issues (including around campfires) and puts the grass on the new landscape meshes added by this mod.\n<br />\n<br />[center][youtube]pkHsIuPemEo[/youtube][/center]\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/P3XCQ0n.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Adds 16 new quests plus 2 mini-quests that are completed without journal entries\n<br />[*]Supplements 4 vanilla quests by making them impact the game world\n<br />[*]Over 18,000 words of new dialogue\n<br />[*]Complete overhaul of the Tel Vos and Vos settlements and the two nearby egg mines\n<br />[*]Turns Vos into an actual farming village with wickwheat fields, a marshmerrow farm, and egg miners to work the nearby mine\n<br />[*]Landscape detailing to the cells surrounding the settlements - covering much of the northern Grazelands region\n<br />[*]15 new interior cells between the two settlements.

A second patch covers the Remiros' Groundcover and Trackless Grazelands patch by RandomPal. Other grass mods are not directly supported.\n<br />\n<br />If you use [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44315]Old Vos Tradepost[/url], install the patch included with this mod over the original plugin.\n<br />\n<br />This mod is a complete replacement of my Tower of Vos mod. They should [b]not [/b]be used together.\n<br />\n<br />This mod now includes my Girith's Guar Hides mod. They should [b]not [/b]be used together.\n<br />\n<br />This mod should be loaded after\xa0Stuporstar's\xa0Quest Tweaks and Alternatives in order to overwrite the minor tweaks that mod makes to the quest which will otherwise break the quest with OAAB Grazelands installed.\n<br />\n<br />This mod is not currently compatible with Red Vos due to issues with the old patch.\n<br />\n<br />This mod is not currently compatible with Less Generic Nerevarine (LGN edits the criteria for the Zainab Ebony quest in a way which conflicts with this mod).\n<br />\n<br />This mod is currently not compatible with Pegas Horse Ranch (which makes extensive landscape changes near Tel Vos). No patch is planned for now.\n<br />\n<br />Due to the extensive changes in this mod, it may be incompatible with other mods which alter the area."
