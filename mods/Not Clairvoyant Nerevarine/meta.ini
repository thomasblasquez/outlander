To know someone's name, you have to ask them about their background. To know a book's name, you have to read it. To know where a door leads, you have to open it. To know what a potion does you have to drink it. A key's name is hidden until you unlock a door or container with it.\n<br />\n<br />=============\n<br />[b][size=3]Installation[/size][/b]\n<br />=============\n<br />Download and install [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/41102]MGE XE[/url]\n<br />If you installed MGE XE manually, then you have to download and install [url=https://nullcascade.com/mwse/mwse-dev.zip]MWSE[/url]\n<br />Install the mod.\n<br />\n<br />=============================\n<br />[b][size=3]Compatibility with other mods[/size][/b]\n<br />=============================\n<br />May conflict with mods that edit 'Background' dialog topic.\n<br />Lua mods that modify tooltips are supported.\n<br />All\xa0vanilla\xa0 NPCs reveal their name when asked about their background, but some mods add NPCs that don't do it.
