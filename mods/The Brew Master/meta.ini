Well now you can! \n<br />This mod allows you to use a brewing station to turn fresh local ingredients into delicious booze. \n<br />\n<br />* Activate a brewing station and you will be given a list of beverages you can brew based on what ingredients you currently have\n<br />\n<br />* Success rate based on alchemy and intelligence, as well as the difficulty of the brew (e.g mazte is easier to make than sujamma)\n<br />\n<br />* To acquire a brewing station, find a publican that likes you and he may give you a little secret about the location of a Brew Master\n<br />\n<br />* Each attempt to brew will cost you one of each ingredient for that beverage\n<br />\n<br />* Bottles are only used up on a successful brewing attempt\n<br />\n<br />* Bottles, flasks and jugs all count as empty bottles\n<br />\n<br />* The brewing station is quite heavy, so it's probably best to set it up at home\n<br />\n<br />* Similar to when you train, one hour will pass upon each brewing attempt\n<br />\n<br />* Ingredients for each beverage are as close to lore friendly as possible. Saltrice for mazte, comberries for greef etc\n<br />\n<br />* Yes the brewing machine is clearly made of an alembic stuffed into the top of a calcinator. I'm not very good with 3d modeling. I think it turned out pretty good though.\n<br />\n<br />|******************************************************************************************************************\n<br />Mod showcase video\n<br />|******************************************************************************************************************\n<br />[youtube]JKJQR9a9DV4[/youtube]\n<br />\n<br />|******************************************************************************************************************\n<br />COMPATIBILITY\n<br />|******************************************************************************************************************\n<br />This mod is not currently compatible with Tamriel rebuilt, as the Brew master is located in an exterior city cell.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />This mod *is* compatible with Openmw."
