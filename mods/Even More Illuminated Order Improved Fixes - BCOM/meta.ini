nexusDescription="[center][font=Georgia][size=6]Illuminated Order Improved Improved Improved Improved[/size][/font][/center]\n<br />\n<br />This is a patch based on Katya's [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/54534]Stoneflower Trading Post[/url]-compatible version, which was based on Folcro's [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/54650]Illuminated Order - More Fixes (.esp only)[/url], which was based on Mort's[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47414] Illuminated Order Improved[/url], which was based on the original classic [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42658]Illuminated Order[/url] by Charles J DeVito. Whew!\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]Requirements\n<br />_______________[/size]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49042]OAAB Data[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44537]Tamriel Data[/url]\n<br />You'll also need to download [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47414]Illuminated Order Improved[/url] for the assets, this is just an esp replacer fix.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff0000]!![/color] OpenMW users: make sure to get [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51223]stonedoughnut's patch[/url] and run it [b]alongside/after [/b]this mod. It prevents a game-breaking bug that only happens on OpenMW.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff0000]!![/color] [b]Rocky West Gash[/b] users:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]If you [color=#ff0000]don't[/color] use BCOM or [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47978]HOTV Gnisis[/url]\xfeff, you can use my patch from the optional files. Please be aware that it contains fixes for assorted other mods as well (Caldera Priory, Tamrielic Treasures, Dwemer Legacy Reforged - Arkngthunch-Sturdumz, Stoneflower Trading Post).\n<br />[*]If you [color=#ff0000]DO[/color] use BCOM ([url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49231]Beautiful Cities of Morrowind[/url]\xfeff), use [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/53420]Devilish Rocky West Gash[/url]\xfeff instead. Devilish Rocky West Gash is probably a good option even if you don't use BCOM, but it will remove slightly more of the rocks than my version does.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]Changelog in this version:\n<br />__________________________[/size]\n<br />[b]\n<br />v1.1\n<br />[/b][x] Fixes an issue with the lich transformation causing problems on OpenMW - thank you Ronik for the fix!\n<br />[x] Fixes the books in Gnisis Temple not having any ownership - thanks Danae for the report\n<br />[b]\n<br />v1.0\n<br />\n<br />[/b][b]Demnevanni Manor int:[/b]\n<br />[x] Moved to beside Stoneflower Trading Post by Katya's version\n<br />[x] Rotated building to fit better with the Stoneflower Trading Post\n<br />[x] OAABified interior, removed set mixing.
