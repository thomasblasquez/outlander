Covering all the terrain and creatures of Morrowind, Tribunal, Bloodmoon, and the Official Addons, CSO also offers support for an expanding collection of mods detailed below.\n<br />\n<br />Through the MCM, CSO is easily customized to suit your audio preferences, but custom sounds may be installed simply by dropping any .wav file into the designated folders. This extends to spell effects, simply add a folder with the [url=https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/references/magic-effects/]Spell Effect ID[/url], fill with sounds following the existing examples, and the spell effect with have its own unique tracks. These may be in addition to the existing sounds, or replacers for them. If you wish to share your soundpack here on the Nexus or elsewhere, please consult the permissions section below.\n<br />\n<br />[b][u]III.

Compatibility:[/b][/u]\n<br />\n<br />This mod IS NOT compatible with OpenMW, at least until support for MWSE mods or a similar feature that allows for this kind of scripting is implemented.

Authors who ask will be prioritized.\n<br />\n<br />[u]Covered Mods:[/u]\n<br />\n<br />This mod does NOT require the following mods, but their textures and/or objects have been covered to allow the proper sounds to play while active.
