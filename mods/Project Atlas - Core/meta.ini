This is bad for performance and is one of the game's primary FPS bottlenecks. Each shape (even within a single mesh file) requires its own drawcall. There are close to 5,000 different textures in Morrowind's data; many of which are very similar or outright identical and some meshes are split into more than 75 different shapes. Merging those meshes into a single shape which references a single texture atlas is the ideal situation for game performance.\n<br />\n<br />The goal of [u]Project Atlas[/u] (PA) is to identify the most performance heavy areas of vanilla Morrowind and some popular mods and target high usage/strain meshes in those areas for atlasing. This effort involves reworking the UVs for those meshes and creating texture atlases to cover various sets.\n<br />[b][center][size=4]\n<br />[/size][size=3][url=https://github.com/revenorror/Project-Atlas]Follow the project's development on GitHub[/url][/size][/center][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/tjxmrs9m4zs1sdg/Atlas_Team.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]FloorBelow\n<br />[*]Greatness7\n<br />[*]Lord Berandas\n<br />[*]Melchior Dahrk\n<br />[*]MwGek\n<br />[*]Petethegoat\n<br />[*]Pop000100\n<br />[*]R-Zero\n<br />[*]Remiros\n<br />[*]revenorror\n<br />[*]RubberMan\n<br />[*]Sataniel\n<br />[*]Stuporstar\n<br />[*]vtastek\n<br />[*]Wollibeebee\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[b][img]https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/ormk4eylci5mb2x/Atlas_Related.png[/img][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45384]Morrowind Optimization Patch[/url].

If you wish to attempt to create your own atlases, you will have to download version 0.7.1 or older to access the deprecated BAT files. But this is NOT SUPPORTED and any bug reports or comments regarding this topic will be removed.\n<br />\n<br />If you use a texture replacer which is not included in PA, we recommend you work with the mod author to create their own atlas.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/out37a4fdddpu5t/Atlas_Modders.png[/img]\xfeff\n<br />It is highly recommended that new assets for the game be made using texture atlases as a best practice - especially when used in cities. Modders are free to use the assets from the [u]Project Atlas[/u] mods in their own projects (e.g. White Suran 2 used the Hlaalu Atlas). You can find the batch files for generating texture atlases for your texture replacer mods on the [url=https://github.com/revenorror/Project-Atlas]project GitHub[/url]. The team is active in the [url=https://discord.gg/g5E2HUp]Discord OAAB Server\n<br />[/url] #project-atlas channel for any questions on how to make your own atlased meshes and textures or if you're interested in joining the team!"
