nexusDescription="Bethesda initially made a single ground mesh that was poorly optimised and the UV map was poorly done resulting in the textures\xa0 becoming stretched and distorted around the sides of the mesh and they often only used a small portion of the texture so they don't have as much detail or look as good as they might if done properly. This mesh was subsequently copied to create all the other clothing meshes so the same fundamental flaws are present in all of them.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Optimisation : The modified meshes\xa0 have been stripped down to bare metal as far as i currently know how to do,\xa0 they contain only essential data required for the meshes to work correctly in game , things like redundant properties present in some,\xa0 long winded ,irrelevant and often confusing property names present in all\xa0 were deleted. The file sizes of the sleeker modified meshes are smaller than than the clogged up originals and is intended to help the nifs load and run a little faster.\n<br />\n<br />UV maps :\xa0 Bethesda used a variety\xa0 of texturing techniques when making the textures for Morrowind's clothing which were also used to cover the corresponding ground meshes . Some are atlas textures , some are wrap around textures, and others are front view\xa0 upper ot lower body , and some robes are full length, so each ground mesh was inspected individually and the UV map adjusted according to the specific texture type used. The stretching and distortion around the edges is greatly reduced , and in many cases it was possible and beneficial to use a larger portion of a texture than Bethesda did to include more detail for improved visual effect and in some cases , it is easier\xa0 to identify what item of clothing the ground mesh is supposed to be.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Slartibartfast"
