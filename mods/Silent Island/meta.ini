nexusDescription="[font=Georgia][center][size=6]Silent Island[/size]\n<br />[size=3][size=2]by Billyfighter[/size][/size][/center]\n<br />[size=3]Starting in Dagon Fel, talk to a woman named Vioua. You can find her with a skiff along with her companion Swabs-The-Decks in need of help going undercover onto an island ran by the Sixth House. [/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][u]Notable features: [/u]\n<br />[font=Georgia]\n<br />- All bosses can be killed by the environment.[/font]\n<br />\n<br />- This mod can be played at level 1, though keeping companions alive for the best ending may be difficult.\n<br />\n<br />- Companions can be ignored or die and the quest will continue onward.\n<br />\n<br />- Companions comment on what should be done next.\n<br />\n<br />- Enemies don't always need to be killed, many can be avoided or left to the companions.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][u]Summary:[/u][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]This is a [/size][s]Silent Hill[/s][size=3] horror themed mod, with pirates, Sixth House, and romance. Though this mod plays fairly different, where many tough enemies can be killed by the environment, or some areas are simply jump puzzles. You can play the mod running and avoiding enemies the entire way, or kill every single one of them. Since enemies can be killed by the environment this means the mod can be done entirely at level 1, though not without difficulty. You'll also need to keep certain NPCs alive, but companions will come and go along the way.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]There are different ways to end this adventure, who you kill and who you rescue can determine the reward and ending, and there are special options and dialogue for the Nerevarine. Even if you think you failed you can keep going. Companions will react to your choices or even comment on what must be done next. Many of the hidden rewards are found along the way.\xa0 [/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]Many scripts were used, but this mod was heavily tested to work in OpenMW and vanilla with as minimal differences between the two as possible.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]OAAB is required, version 1.9.0 was used making this mod.[/size]\n<br />[size=3]\n<br />No exterior landscape changes were made. This quest takes place within interior cells besides some activity at Dagon Fel.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[u][size=4]Recommended mods:[/size][/u][size=3]\xa0[/size]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45712]Easy Escort[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50067]Dagon Fell Mill[/url][font=Georgia]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[u][size=4]Known issues/conflicts:[/size][/u][/font]\n<br />\n<br />[u][b]Console commands[/b][/u][size=3] to move to areas without getting the right key or switch, or using resurrect [/size][u][b]can break the quest line[/b][/u][size=3]. I did not intend to punish anyone for cheating, it's just that the mod is too complex to consider console commands.[/size][font=Georgia][size=3] If an NPC dies you should reload or keep playing, any NPC deaths (even vital ones) are accounted for and you shouldn't be stuck if any NPCs die during the quest unless resurrection is used.\n<br />\n<br />Sometimes if a companion is stuck, you have to open the console and click on them and type \"StopCombat\". This is a vanilla engine issue which sometimes breaks scripted events. Does not happen in OpenMW.\n<br />[/size][/font]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45712]Easy Escort[/url][size=3] will bring companions here which can cause problems. Though I'd certainly suggest using it because there are companions in this mod, you should avoid bringing other companions to Silent Island as scripted events do not account for them being there. Just make sure to ask them to stay behind![/size]\n<br />[size=3]\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[u]Notes:[/u]\n<br />\n<br />Every NPC death, situation, and altered outcomes have been attempted to be accounted for. This mod uses over a hundred scripts and hundreds of hours went into making this mod as fluid as possible. Though it may be a bit different and won't exactly feel like Morrowind it's still lore-friendly.\n<br />\n<br />This mod was heavily tested in the OpenMW and vanilla engines, but if any errors do come up, the prefix used in all scripts and references is \"SHP\". This mod runs more efficiently in OpenMW, due to better path grids and no vanilla engine bugs that you can't avoid. This was a very complex project, so I'll be careful not to make anything overly complex for Morrowind in the future.\n<br />\n<br />A big thanks to Thea Solone for voice acting Vioua and Dagoth Xela.
