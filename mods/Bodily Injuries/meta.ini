These injuries drain your attributes and have other negative effects, depending on which body part(s) were injured. It always troubled me that you could be at ten percent health and still operate as if you were completely healthy. No longer! The more damage you take, the more injuries your body will suffer, and the more severe those injuries can become.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Mod features and details\n<br />[/b]-------------------------------------\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]You can suffer damage to your head, chest, arms, and legs.\n<br />[*]It takes a fair amount of damage before you experience these injuries - you will not see these at ninety percent health.\n<br />[*]Damage to different areas affects you in different ways. A leg injury affects your Speed, an arm injury affects your Strength, a chest injury affects your Strength and Fatigue, and a head injury affects your Agility and Intelligence. A head injury is the worst of the four - if serious enough it also affects your vision and you'll have a ringing in your ears.\n<br />[*]For each of these areas, damage can come in three tiers. This is determined by your health percentage.\n<br />[*]High levels of Strength or Willpower will allow you to take more damage before suffering these injuries.\n<br />[*]To remove these injuries, heal yourself in any way Morrowind provides.\n<br />[*]Works with new or existing characters.\n<br />[*]By default, this mod's script runs once every two seconds. To make this more frequent (for more immediate injuries when damage is taken), enter the console and type \"Set InjuryDelay to X\", where X is how frequent in seconds you want the script to run. You may enter a fraction of a second if you like. For example: \"Set InjuryDelay to 0.5\" will cause the script to run once every half-second.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />====================\n<br />[b]Installation Instructions[/b]\n<br />====================\n<br />1. Save and back-up your game. This is a good idea any time you start using a new mod.\n<br />2. Install the content of this archive into your Morrowind/Data Files folder.\n<br />3. Enable \"Bodily Injuries\" in your mod list.\n<br />4. To update the mod, just replace it with the new file.\n<br />5. Enjoy your grievous head wound.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />=============\n<br />[b]Version History[/b]\n<br />=============\n<br />v1.2\n<br />------\n<br />Changed injury effects to have a range of attribute hits instead of being the same every time.\n<br />Removed all \"you have suffered an injury ...\" messages.\n<br />Changed the names of \"Minor\" and \"Serious\" injuries to only note location. \"Grievous,\" however, remains in the name of the most serious injuries.\n<br />Made the script more frequent (every two seconds) to apply effects more quickly.\n<br />\n<br />v1.1\n<br />------\n<br />Added ability to change frequency of script through the console.\n<br />\n<br />v1.0\n<br />------\n<br />Original release.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />======[b]\n<br />Credits\n<br />[/b]======\n<br />GhanBuriGhan, Yacoby and Melian for the guide [i]Morrowind Scripting for Dummies[/i]. An absolutely invaluable tool for modders.\n<br />Thanks to WanderRA for the improvement suggestions.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />=========================\n<br />[b]RacerPlume's Family of Mods[/b]\n<br />=========================\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46495]Bad Weather Matters[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46405]Bodily Injuries[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46507]Cooking and Eating[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46509]Water and Thirst[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47356]Yurt Crafting[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47212]Armorer's Dismantling Tool[/url]"
