nexusDescription="[b][size=4]Take That!\xa0\xa0[/size][/b]\n<br />[size=2]A Modern Combat Mod for Morrowind by Storm Atronach[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b]Take That![/b] overhauls Morrowind\x2019s melee combat with new, timing-based mechanics: blocking, parrying, dodging, and spell batting. Each mechanic rewards skill, timing, and character build, making combat more dynamic and reactive.\n<br />All features are highly configurable via the in-game Mod Configuration Menu (MCM).\n<br />\n<br />Update: Playtesting is on track. If you find a bug or something doesn't seem to work, please post a comment here on Nexus or contact me in the Morrowind Modding Community discord. Next stretch goals are:\n<br />- Providing skill experience on sucessful blocks, dodges, and parries.\n<br />\n<br />Mechanics\n<br />[b]\xa0\x31. Blocking[/b]\n<br />- Block Window: Press your chosen hotkey to enter a brief block window (default: 1s, key: b).\n<br />- Cooldown: Blocking has a configurable cooldown (default: 3s).\n<br />- Types:\xa0\xa0\n<br />\xa0 - Sword &amp; Board: Block with a shield and one-handed weapon.\n<br />\xa0 - Weapon Only: Block with a two-handed weapon or one-handed weapon without a shield.\n<br />\xa0 - Unarmed (Kung Fu): Block with empty hands (and no shield!).\n<br />\n<br />Formulas\n<br />Shield Block:\n<br />Reduction = clamp(block_shield_base_pc + block_shield_skill_mult * Block Skill, 0, 100)\n<br />Damage Taken = Original Damage * (100 - Reduction) / 100\n<br />Shield Condition Loss = Original Damage * Reduction / 100\n<br />\n<br />Weapon Block:\n<br />Reduction = clamp(block_weapon_base_pc + block_weapon_skill_mult * Weapon Skill, 0, 100)\n<br />Damage Taken = Original Damage * (100 - Reduction) / 100\n<br />Weapon Condition Loss = Original Damage * Reduction / 100\n<br />\n<br />Unarmed Block (Kung Fu):\n<br />- Effects scale with Hand-to-Hand skill (every 25 points).\n<br />- At higher skill, can stun, knockdown, paralyze, or even poison attackers.\n<br />\n<br />[b]2. Parrying[/b]\n<br />- How: Perform a power attack (fully drawn) to enter a parry window (default: 0.5s).\n<br />- Cooldown: Parrying has a configurable cooldown (default: 3s).\n<br />- Effect: If hit during the window, the attack is negated and an opposed skill check occurs.\n<br />Opposed Skill Check:\n<br />Player Skill Level = floor(Weapon Skill / 25)\n<br />Attacker Skill Level = floor(Weapon Skill / 25)\n<br />Result = Player Skill Level - Attacker Skill Level\n<br />- Results range from both parties being stunned to the attacker being knocked down and slowed, depending on the difference.\n<br />\n<br />[b]3. Dodging[/b]\n<br />- How: Jump to dodge (if not on cooldown).\n<br />- Window: Dodge duration scales with Acrobatics and armor weight:\n<br />\xa0 Dodge Duration = clamp(0.1 + (Acrobatics Level / 10) + Armor Contribution, 0.1, 1)\n<br />\xa0\xa0No armor = +0.5s,\xa0Light armor = +0.35s, Medium = +0.2s, Heavy = 0,\xa0\n<br />- Effect: Grants Sanctuary (100%) for the dodge window.\n<br />- Cooldown: Configurable (default: 3s).\n<br />\n<br />[b]4. Spell Batting[/b]\n<br />- How: Perform a power attack with sufficient weapon skill (configurable minimum).\n<br />- Window: After a short delay, you gain a brief Reflect or Shield effect (configurable window).\n<br />- Effect: Incoming spells can be reflected if they hit during this window.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Bonus[/b]: If you have MM Enhanced Reflection installed, the shield reflect mechanic from that mod will apply.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Additional Features[/b]\n<br />- Slowdown Effects: Successful blocks and parries can slow attackers, scaling with your skill.\n<br />- Stun/Knockdown: High skill blocks and parries can stun or knock down attackers.\n<br />- Configurable Hotkey: Choose your block hotkey in the MCM.\n<br />- Restore Defaults: Easily reset all settings in the MCM.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Configuration[/b]\n<br />All timings, skill multipliers, and thresholds can be adjusted in the MCM.\xa0\xa0\n<br />Default values are balanced for a challenging but fair experience.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Requirements[/b]\n<br />- MWSE (latest nightly)\n<br />- Optional: MM Enhanced Reflection\n<br />\n<br />[b]Credits[/b]\n<br />MWSE Team and particularly Greatness7, without whose guidance this mod would not have been possible!\n<br />Special thanks to the Morrowind modding community and Yoshiyuki Saito for the inspiration and insights!\n<br />\n<br />Take That and Have fun!"
