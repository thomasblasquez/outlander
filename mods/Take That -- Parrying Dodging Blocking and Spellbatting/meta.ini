Designed for players who want a more engaging and skillful combat experience, each feature rewards precision, awareness, and smart character builds.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Update! [/b]We\x2019ve reached a stable version! All mechanics are fully configurable through the Mod Configuration Menu (MCM), allowing you to fine-tune settings to your preferences. Mix, match, and customize your combat style.\n<br />\n<br />Mechanics\n<br />[b]\xa0\x31. Blocking[/b]\n<br />- Block Window: Press your chosen hotkey to enter a brief block window (default: 1s, key: b).\n<br />- Cooldown: Blocking has a configurable cooldown (default: 3s).\n<br />- Types:\xa0\xa0\n<br />[b]A - Sword &amp; Board[/b]: Block with a shield and one-handed weapon. The leveling mechanics are:\n<br />   \xfeff- Damage reduction: starts at 50%, and scales with half your block skill. At Master (100), damage when sucessfully blocking is reduced to 0.\n<br />   - Perks:\n<br />      \xfeff\xfeff- Novice (0-24), a sucessful block will briefly stun the opponent.\n<br />      \xfeff\xfeff- Apprentice (25-49), a sucessful block will also reduce their speed by 25% for 2 seconds\n<br />      \xfeff\xfeff- Journeyman (50-74), the opponent is slowed by 50%\n<br />      \xfeff\xfeff- Expert (75-99), the opponent speed is reduced by 75%\n<br />      \xfeff\xfeff- Master (100), the opponnent is stopped for 2 seconds.\n<br />   \xfeff- Progression Each successful block gives block skill xp.\n<br />[b]B - Weapon[/b]: Block with a two-handed weapon or one-handed weapon without a shield (or while dual wielding weapons if you are using Double Chim).\n<br />   \xfeff- Damage reduction: Starts at 20% and scales with 0.6*your weapon skill. At Master level, damage is reduced by 80% when blocking with a weapon.\n<br />   \xfeff- Perks: Same as sword and boad.\n<br />   \xfeff- Progression: Each successful block will increase your weapon skill.\n<br />   \xfeff- [u]Alternative mode[/u]: If you activate it in the MCM, your block skill will contribute to the damage reduction. Each successful block will raise your block skill instead.\n<br />\n<br />[b]C -\xa0[/b][b]Unarmed (Kung Fu)[/b]: Block with empty hands (and no shield!).\n<br />   \xfeff- Damage reduction: No damage reduction at novice and apprentice, jumps to 50% at journeyman, 75% at expert and at Master level, damage is reduced to 0.\n<br />   \xfeff- Perks:\n<br />   \xfeff   \xfeff- Novice and apprentice: Brief stun\n<br />   \xfeff   \xfeff- Journeyman: Enemy is knocked down and speed reduced by 25% for 2 seconds\n<br />   \xfeff   \xfeff- Expert: Nerve attack! enemy is knocked down and paralyzed for 5 seconds\n<br />   \xfeff   \xfeff- Master: Death touch!

Parrying[/b]\n<br />- How: Perform a power attack (fully drawn) to enter a parry window (default: 0.2s).\n<br />- Cooldown: Parrying has a progressive cooldown. Each succesive attack will reduce your parry window\n<br />- Effect: If hit during the window, the attack is negated and an opposed skill check occurs.\n<br />Opposed Skill Check:\n<br />Player Skill Level = floor(Weapon Skill / 25)\n<br />Attacker Skill Level = floor(Weapon Skill / 25)\n<br />Result = Player Skill Level - Attacker Skill Level\n<br />- If Result is less than 0, both attacker and player are stunned.\n<br />- If Result is 0, only the attacker is stunned.\n<br />- If result is 1, the attacker is stunned and slowed 25% for 1 second\n<br />- At 2, the attacker is knocked down and slowed 50% for 1 second\n<br />- At 3,\xa0the attacker is knocked down and slowed 75% for 1 second\n<br />- [b]Option: [/b]NPCs can parry the player for an interesting challenge! You can enable this in the MCM\n<br />\n<br />- As a bonus, you can try your luck batting arrows just as they're about to hit you!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]3.
