nexusDescription="[left][/left][center]\xfeff\xfeff[img]https://i.imgur.com/QCrTidp.png[/img]\n<br />\xfeff[/center]2.0 - Added Tribunal/Bloodmoon Reputation Gain. Details in description.\n<br />\n<br />1.1 - [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/users/70336838?tab=user+files&amp;BH=4]Necroleasian [/url]forwarded PFP fixes and helped to stop a way to potentially cheese too much reputation from end-game fighter's guild quests.\n<br />   \xfeffThanks Necroleasian!\n<br />\n<br />I didn't know modathon was happening, but sure!\n<br />\n<br />In Morrowind you have global reputation (separate from your faction reputations) that can change how NPCs react to you, some vendor prices, and even in an extreme case, skip a large part of the main questline!\n<br />\n<br />You gain this reputation by completing quests, and the faction quests specifically earn you a good amount of reputation.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />You can get 17\xa0 reputation from House Hlaalu quests\n<br />13 from Redoran\n<br />18 from Telvanni\n<br />19 from Imperial Cult\n<br />14 from Tribunal Temple\n<br />13 from Morag Tong\n<br />14 from the Mages Guild\n<br />...\n<br />1 from the Imperial Legion\n<br />0 from the Fighters Guild\n<br />0 from the Thieves guild\n<br />\n<br />While some leeway can be given to the Thieves guild since you shouldn't be noticed for most of those quests, the Legion and Fighters Guild numbers seem like an oversight to me.\n<br />\n<br />With this mod completing all quests for these 3 factions now gives:\n<br />\n<br />13 from the Imperial Legion\n<br />17 from the Fighter's Guild (though unlikely to get all of it due to how this questline branches)\n<br />5 from the Thieves Guild\n<br />\n<br />I kept the Thieves Guild lower because there are only a handful of quests that have you publicly do something reputation-worthy. You don't join the Thieves Guild for the attention.\n<br />\n<br />Now if you complete the main quest through the sixth house base quests and do all quests for any 3 non thieves guild quest lines, you should be able to get the 50 reputation needed for skipping part of the main quest (judging by the reputation gain of the other factions, this was roughly how it was intended to work).\n<br />\n<br />This mod was extremely simple to make, so feel free to take it, integrate into your mods, made it better, whatever.\n<br />\n<br />Below here I'll list all the quests I edited to give reputation. Thanks for reading outlander!\n<br />\n<br />Imperial Legion\n<br />\n<br />Rescue Joncis Dalomax +1\n<br />Lord's Mail +2\n<br />Grandmaster Duel +3\n<br />Suryn Athones' Slanders +1\n<br />Honthjolf is a Traitor +1\n<br />Rescue Dandsa +1\n<br />Rescue Jocien Ancois +1\n<br />Sorkvild the Raven +1\n<br />Talos Cult Conspiracy +1\n<br />Rescue Ragash gra-Shuzgub +1\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Fighers Guild\n<br />Kill the Master Thief +2\n<br />Remove the Heads of the Thieves Guild +1\n<br />Kill Hard-Heart +3\n<br />   This is so high because it's combined with Remove Sjoring's Supporters, they're just chained in a way that made it easier to give you all the reputation at the end. Think of this as Remove Sjoring Supporters +1 and Kill Hard-Heart +2\n<br />Bandits in Suran +1\n<br />The Necromancer of Vas +1\n<br />   Only if Ulyne Henim gives you a good review. Otherwise no reputation gain.\n<br />Beneran's Bounty +1 from\xa0\n<br />Gra-Bol's Bounty +1\n<br />Alof and the Orcs +1\n<br />The Verethi Gang +1\n<br />Hunger in the Sarano Tomb +1\n<br />Alleius' Bounty +1\n<br />Tenim's Bounty +1\n<br />Sondaale +1\n<br />Engaer's Bounty +1\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Theives Guild\n<br />Find Brother Nads\xa0 +1\n<br />   Only if you kill Arvama. Otherwise no reputation gain.\n<br />The Brother's Ienith +1\n<br />Kill Hard-Hart +2\n<br />The Bitter Cup +1\n<br />\n<br />2.0 adds reputation to DLC!\n<br />\n<br />Tribunal\n<br />Hunt the Dark Brotherhood\xa0 +2\n<br />Evidence of Conspiracy +1 (only if all three are killed)\n<br />The Goblin Army +1\n<br />   +1 bonus if you kill both trainers as well\n<br />The Shrine of the Dead +1\xa0If Urvel Survives\n<br />Barilzar's Mazed Band +2\n<br />An Assassination Attempt +3\n<br />Helseth's Champion +1\n<br />A Show of Power +1\n<br />The Blade of Nerverar +3\n<br />The Mad God +5\n<br />\n<br />Non-Main Quest Bonus!\n<br />A Star Is Born +1 if you get all your lines right\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Bloodmoon\n<br />The Frostmoth Smugglers/The Disappearance of Capitain Carius +2\n<br />The Skaal Test of Loyalty +1\n<br />The Skaal Test of Wisdom +1\n<br />The Skaal Test of Strength +1\n<br />The Totem of Claw and Fang +1\n<br />The Castle Karstaag +1\n<br />Dream of Hircine +1\n<br />Disrupt the Skaal Hunt +1\n<br />Siege of Castle Karstaag +1\n<br />Hircine's Hunt +5\n<br />\n<br />Non-Main Quest Bonus!\n<br />Raven Rock Questline +5 on completion of either side\n<br />\n<br />Last note, yes if you get to the top of the Thieves guild and Fighters guild, then Kill Hard-Hard, you will get a total of 5 reputation for killing him (2 form Thieves, 3 from Fighters). This would be easy to fix, but the way I see it, you just became the top rank in two opposing guilds and brought them together so you've earned that rep.\n<br />\n<br />Lastly, I'm thinking of making another mod that make reputation do more throughout the game. Feel free to let me know any ideas you might have in the comments.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center]\xfeff[img]https://i.imgur.com/htPWgF5.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/revmHlc.png[/img]\n<br />\xfeff[img]https://i.imgur.com/syvCVhu.png[/img]\n<br />\xfeff[img]https://i.imgur.com/LWJXRbd.png[/img]\xfeff[/center]"
