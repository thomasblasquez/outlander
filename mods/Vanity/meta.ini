nexusDescription="Vanity by abot\n<br />\n<br />Visible equipped amulets &amp; rings.\n<br />That's it. Now it should be working also for NPCs :-)\n<br />\n<br />[youtube]RldxaPx1DbI[/youtube]\n<br />[youtube]MePdxF92KVo[/youtube]\n<br />\n<br />Versions History:\n<br />\n<br />\xa0\x31.07\n<br />Amulet settings saved if tweaked according to current player robe/cuirass/amulet meshes\n<br />More tweaks and fixes[list]\n<br />[/list]1.06\n<br />Using enableracemenu vanilla scripting command (to change player race/when starting a new game)\n<br />should not require a save/reload any more to refresh player visual attachments\n<br />\n<br />1.05\n<br />Try and fix te3.loadAnimation currently nuking player visual attachments.\n<br />Should avoid mods using it (e.g. Double CHIM, 4NM - Total Gameplay Overhaul,\n<br />Sails and Sales, The Art of Alchemy, Dwemer Cycle...) disabling visual\n<br />attachments added by Vanity.\n<br />\n<br />1.04\n<br />minor code tweaks\n<br />\n<br />1.03\n<br />now 3rd extra ring is visible in 1st person view on the same finger as in 3rd person view\n<br />\n<br />1.02\n<br />Now working also with NPCs\n<br />\n<br />1.01\n<br />fixed link to correct required Better Bodies version; increased allowed ring displacement range a little\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Requirements:\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://nullcascade.com/mwse/mwse-dev.zip]Latest MWSE-Lua development build[/url] (install it after MGE-XE)\n<br />\n<br />Suggested:\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/19510?tab=files&amp;file_id=1000007846]Morrowind Code Patch[/url] + [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/26348?tab=files&amp;file_id=1000013757]Beta update[/url] option to enable 1 extra on-use ring slot highly suggested to enable one more shiny.\n<br />\n<br />Default \"3. In NPC's inventory\" option will display equipped/in inventory amulets and rings on any playable race NPC.\n<br />\"0. Disabled\" is mostly to temporarily disable the mod effects.\n<br />Disabling \"2. Equipped by NPCs\" or \"3. In NPC's inventory\" usually will refresh the\n<br />amulet and rings graphics on currently loaded NPCs on next cell load.\n<br />Only equipped amulet and rings will be visible on player (else it would become confusing to understand\n<br />what items you have currently equipped), while NPCs can show also unequipped amulet and rings.\n<br />This is because NPCs may not always equip items, and items equipped by NPCs are no more accessible\n<br />from NPCs inventory/barter menus so it's better to avoid messing with how default game/other mods equip them.\n<br />Suggested Morrowind Code Patch options:\n<br />Over-the-shoulder third person camera, Reduce camera clipping, Vanity camera lock\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/41102]MGE-XE[/url]\n<br />\n<br />Suggested MGE-XE camera settings:\n<br />[Misc]\n<br />Customize 3rd Person Camera=True\n<br />Initial 3rd Person Camera X=0\n<br />Initial 3rd Person Camera Y=-160\n<br />Initial 3rd Person Camera Z=16\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47925]Assetless No Glow[/url]\n<br />If you install Assetless No Glow and delete any Textures/magicitem/caustXX.dds you will still have no-glow armors but keep the vanilla magic effect for pretty shiny glow on amulets and rings.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42395]Better Bodies[/url]\n<br />Amulets and rings positioning is tweaked/tested using Better Bodies (and optimized for Breton female race), using vanilla/other body replacers may not work the same.\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://mw.modhistory.com/download-10-11364]New Beast Bodies[/url]\n<br />Amulets and rings positioning is tweaked/tested using New Beast Bodies, using vanilla/other body replacers may not work the same\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />I was thinking the hard part to be getting and placing the meshes...\n<br />I had no idea how difficult tweaking the ring positions could be.\n<br />Almost as tedious as pathing silt striders for the whole Vvardenfell. Almost.\n<br />\n<br />It may not work well for everybody, but sorry I'm not going to test these things with different setups,\n<br />you should at least be able to tweak the rings and amulet positions for your player race\n<br />from the Mod MCM panel so give it a try in case.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Tech notes:\n<br />you can reset the configuration setting deleting the Data Files&#92;MWSE&#92;config&#92;abotVanity.json file\n<br />\n<br />If you set Logging level higher than 0, pressing Shift+Alt+D will show a debug testing option\n<br />allowing you to reset amulet and rings visibility and get one of each different looking\n<br />amulets, rings, gloves, gauntlets, shirts, cuirasses, robes.\n<br />Warning: if your loading list is adding tons of these items, this will take some time\n<br />and may appear to freeze your game, please wait!"
