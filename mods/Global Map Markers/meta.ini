nexusDescription="[b]What it does: [/b]Adds exterior map markers to all dungeons in the vanilla game, as well as Tamriel Rebuilt's latest release. They only show up once you discover them, like in Oblivion and later games.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Requirements:\xa0[/b]Just the vanilla game is needed. A no-TR version is available due to popular request.\n<br />\n<br />[b]To install:[/b] just unzip the file to the Data Files folder and check the mod in Data Files.\n<br />\n<br />[b]To uninstall:[/b] It's not as simple as just deleting the GlobalMapMarkers.esp. After disabling the mod, use the Update Map feature in Wrye Mash. Unfortunately, since Update Map does funny things to the world map, you would need to reset the world map. Download Morrowind Enchanted Editor and open up your save file (make sure to back up first!). Go to Player Map and delete the FMAP record. Save and play.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Incompatiblities:[/b] Incompatible with Rebirth. May make a patch if there's enough demand for it."
