nexusDescription="This MWSE mod allows you to[b] [color=#cc4125]spend[/color][/b][b] [color=#3c78d8]time[/color] [color=#6aa84f]training[/color][/b] rather than [b][color=#cc4125]wasting[/color] [color=#3c78d8]time [/color][color=#6aa84f]waiting[/color][/b]!\n<br />\n<br />I always thought using the \"Wait\" function was a waste of time/not immersive when waiting for more than a few hours. So I decided to add another option. The default settings are considered \"Medium Difficulty\".\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b][color=#cc4125]Features:[/color][/b]\n<br />[/size]\n<br />A \"Train\" button is added to the rest menu, which allows you to select a skill to train for the amount of hours you selected. The amount of hours you are able to train per session is limited by [color=#8e7cc3]Willpower[/color] for [color=#8e7cc3]magical skills[/color] and [color=#38761d]Endurance[/color] for[color=#38761d] non-magical skills[/color]. This is configurable.\n<br />\n<br />Once you finish training, a cooldown is invoked. By default, the cooldown is 24 hours. This is configurable. In addition to this,[color=#cc4125] Training Fatigue [/color][color=#efefef]may reduce [/color][color=#38761d]Endurance[/color][color=#efefef] or\xa0[/color][color=#8e7cc3]Willpower [/color][color=#f4f4f4]temporarily.[/color]\n<br />\n<br />You can disallow [i]all [/i]training or just [i]dangerous[/i] training in towns. You can optionally have the chance of being ambushed while training outside of towns. You can also limit the maximum skill level a skill can be trained to. The rate of experience gain is also configurable. Experience efficiency bonuses and penalties can affect how well your training sessions go.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=#cc4125]Training[/color][color=#3d85c6] different[/color] [color=#6aa84f]skills[/color] [color=#cc4125]requires[/color][color=#3d85c6] different[/color][color=#6aa84f] resources[/color].[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[/b]Training[color=#cc4125] armor skills[/color] requires a small amount of [color=#cc4125]health per hour[/color] by default.\n<br />\n<br />Training [color=#3d85c6]magic skills[/color] requires a fair amount of [color=#3d85c6]magicka per hour[/color] by default.\n<br />\n<br />Training [color=#6aa84f]all other skills[/color] requires a moderate amount of [color=#6aa84f]stamina per hour[/color] by default.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=#bf9000]An optional daily streak bonus has been included.[/color]\n<br />[/size][/b]\n<br />Once you train the same skill 3 days in a row, you gain a free hour of experience per session (no additional time required). This bonus increases with longer streaks:\n<br />\n<br />Tier 1 (3 - 7 Days): 1 free hour of training per session.\n<br />[color=#6aa84f]Tier 2 (7 - 30 Days): 2 free hours of training per session.[/color]\n<br />[color=#3d85c6]Tier 3 (30 - 180 Days): 3 free hours of training per session.[/color]\n<br />[color=#674ea7]Tier 4 (180 - 365 Days): 4 free hours of training per session.[/color]\n<br />[color=#bf9000]Tier 5 (365+ Days): 5 free hours of training per session.\n<br />\n<br />[/color]You can only have one streak skill active at a time. To change your streak skill, you must first break your current streak!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#3c78d8][size=4]Compatibility:[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />This mod is compatible with the rest menu bar from\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49057]Ashfall[/url].\n<br />\n<br />Please let me know of any unforeseen incompatibilities.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4][color=#6aa84f]Recommended:\xfeff[/color]\n<br />\n<br />[/size][/b][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49057]Ashfall[/url]\xa0\x62y Merlord. Very immersive and configurable survival/immersion mod.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51396]Time Consumer[/url]\xa0\x62y me. Another time related mod, this one makes many actions that [i]should[/i] consume time, [i]actually[/i] consume time for immersion. Configurable.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50840]Clocks[/url]\xa0\x62y jsak. Highly recommend this mod as you can tell the time at a glance."
