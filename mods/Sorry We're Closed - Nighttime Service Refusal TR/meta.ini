Each NPC class has unique night-time greetings and service refusal dialogue to signal this. However, you're still able to speak with them about anything else. This mod does not lock doors at night or move any NPCs.\xa0\n<br />[b][size=4]\n<br />Special exceptions to nighttime service refusal[/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]If an NPC has a disposition of over 80 towards the player, or is at least two ranks below the player in the same faction, they'll make an exception and provide their services.\n<br />[*]Publicans, Pawnbrokers, Guild Guides, Assassins, Nightblades and Thieves Guild members will continue offering services at all hours.\n<br />[*]Healers, Alchemists and Apothecaries also remain available at night, but only for those who are diseased or severely injured.\xa0\n<br />[*]Vampirism: If the player is a vampire, any NPC still willing to offer them services will also do so at night.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[size=4][b]New dialogue[/b]\n<br />[/size]\n<br />Each service-providing class now has unique night-time greetings, acknowledging the late hour and clearly signaling whether services are available. This adds a nice bit of immersion, even when speaking to these NPCs for other reasons. All the classes have multiple service refusal lines as well!\xa0\n<br />\n<br />The greetings are given low priority to avoid overriding unique or quest-related dialogue. Some traders, like Arrille and Ra'Virr, likely won't use them because of this. They will still refuse service as expected!\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4]Compatibility[/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />This mod will automatically cover NPCs added by mods, as long as they were assigned one of the vanilla service classes.\n<br />\n<br />A Tamriel_Data add-on is available, to cover the new service classes created for Tamriel Rebuilt and the Project Tamriel province mods (bakers, jewelers, potters, etc.).\n<br />\n<br />Aside from adding new classes, mods can also add services to NPCs with a non-service class. This is sometimes done to bypass skooma trading restrictions. As a result, service refusal coverage for modded NPCs may not always be perfect, though this can sometimes make sense for those characters.\n<br />\n<br />On the other hand, if service refusals or greetings appear on any NPCs that you think they really shouldn't, let me know! Since the mod only targets specific service classes, I don\x2019t expect any issues.\n<br />\xa0[size=4][b]\n<br />Recommended mods[/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48610]Improved Inns Expanded[/url] will make it easier to find a place to spend the night, until services resume in the morning.\n<br />\n<br />Survival mods like [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49057]Ashfall[/url] or [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/56480]Devilish Needs[/url] make having to wait for shops to open actually have impact on your character. Luckily because publicans still operate at all hours, you should still be able to buy food and drink at night at most inns.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />The greetings and dialogue from [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47253]Djangos Dialogue[/url] work well alongside my mod. My greetings will take priority over some of Djangos' nighttime greetings, to keep them consistent with the service refusal.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51427]Real Disposition[/url] will makes it tougher to reach the 80 disposition needed for NPCs to make an exception. I use the Light version.\n<br />\n<br />I personally don't use [url=https://modding-openmw.gitlab.io/go-home/]Go Home[/url], but it should work very well alongside my mod. That way if you manage to find where service NPCs go at night, they will still refuse you service!\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4]Credits[/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />This mod was initially inspired by Vaelta44's Closed For The Night mod, which had a similar approach to night-time service refusal.\n<br />\n<br />\x22c6\x207a\x208a\x22c6 \x263e\x22c6\x207a\x208a\x22c6\x207a\x208a\x22c6\x207a\x208a\x22c6\x207a\x208a\x22c6\x207a\x208a\x22c6\x207a\x208a\x22c6\x207a\x208a\x22c6\x207a\x208a\x22c6\x207a\x208a\x22c6\x207a\x208a\x22c6\x207a\x208a\x22c6\x207a\x208a\x22c6\x207a\x208a\x22c6\x207a\x208a\x22c6\x207a\x208a\x22c6\x207a\x208a\x22c6\x207a\x208a\x22c6\x207a\x208a\x22c6"
