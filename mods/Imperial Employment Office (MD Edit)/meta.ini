There are a lot of commoners in Vvardenfell who aren't strong fighters or skilled mages. The IEO is there to give them jobs as well. This mod is mostly aimed towards role-players as the jobs are usually quite straight-forward and not too challenging (with one optional exception which does involve some combat).\n<br />\n<br />The IEO can be found in \"Vivec, Foreign Quarter Lower Waistworks\", and gives you day-to-day jobs with payments. As you progress through the faction, you will get jobs that requires more skills and trust. Ultimately, you can become the leader of the Office and get a weekly payment. As the head honcho, you'll also be able to improve your income and the services of the office by approving jobs for your new underlings.\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4]Features[/size][/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]11 new quests\n<br />[*]4 new jobs to give underlings after becoming the head of the IEO\n<br />[*]Over 12,000 words of dialogue and writing\n<br />[*]Pass time by completing boring paperwork\n<br />[*]Custom quest icon if you use [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/53175]SSQN[/url]\xfeff\n<br />[*]Interact with many vanilla NPCs as you complete jobs across Vvardenfell\n<br />[*]Source of income for the player\n<br />[*]Room with bed for the player\n<br />[*]See small changes to the office as your underlings leave their mark\n<br />[*]Brand new dagger model (along with some new lore)\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Some may remember that this was previously hosted on my [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43528]Dahrk Mods[/url]\xfeff page. My edits for 3.0.0 so extensive that I decided to give this mod a dedicated page so that it'd have better visibility and be easier to track issues and suggestions."
