Installation and Removal\n<br />V. Credits and permissions\n<br />[b]\n<br />I. Requirements:[/b]\n<br />\n<br />- Morrowind\n<br />- Tribunal\n<br />- Bloodmoon\n<br />- OAAB Data\n<br />- Tamriel Data\n<br />\n<br />[b]II. Description\n<br />[/b]\n<br />This is an overhaul of the two main plantations of Morrowind: the Dren and Arvel plantations.\n<br />There's no [b]official [/b]concept art for the plantations, but we used the concept art drawings of [b][url=https://www.deviantart.com/romandubina/gallery/50186850/skywind]Roman Dubina[/url]\xa0[/b]and\xa0[b][url=https://www.artstation.com/artwork/1nLraq]Dominik Zdenkovi\x107[/url][/b], two very talented artists.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />The overhaul should make these two plantations feel more structured and fleshed out. We didn't go too crazy on expanding the locations as this is more about redesigning and adding details. \n<br />\n<br />Interesting to notice that there are no new camps for the Dren plantation as it's supposed to be a netch farm, more like a ranch than a plantation.\n<br />\n<br />Arvel plantation being the most important of Vvanderfell has been redesigned to be more productive and suggestive.\n<br />\n<br />In any case, the screenshots should prove a good showcase of what the mod does.\n<br />\n<br />[b]III. Compatibility\n<br />[/b]\n<br />It is not compatible with Morrowind Rebirth or anything that changes the Dren or Arvel plantations.\n<br />It is compatible with BcoM\n<br />\n<br />As optional there are grass patch files for Remiros and Aesthesia Vanilla and for the Beautiful cities of Morrowind mod.\n<br />\n<br />[b]IV. Installation and Removal[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Manager: Mod Organizer 2 or Wrye Mash is highly recommended for easy installation, activation, and removal.\n<br />\n<br />Manual: Extract contents of \"00 - Core Files\" folder to your Morrowind Data \n<br />Files directory, overwrite if needed, then extract the contents of any desired patch folders, let those overwrite, and finally enable any desired plugins in the Morrowind Launcher. To remove this mod, simply deactivate its plugins.\n<br />\n<br />[b]V. Credits[/b]\n<br />Tamriel Rebuilt team, MD OAAB Data and SVNR for the meshes that have been modified for the occasion.\n<br />Duo Dinamico&gt;RandomPal and Vegetto"
