Lightweight, immersive, customizable and compatible.[/color][/center]\n<br />[center]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/OwTqf4W.png[/img][/center]I\xfeff. [b][u]The mod\n<br />\n<br />[/u][/b]Currently available (in one BAIN-friendly package):\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][color=#ff00ff][u]Full[/u][/color] - an integrated hub of AURA modules, including:\n<br />   \xfeff* [u]Outdoor Ambien[/u]t (environment sounds per region, time, and weather)   \xfeff\xfeff* [u]Populated Ambient[/u] (town sounds per culture and time)   \xfeff\xfeff* [u]Interior Ambient[/u] (atmospheric loops for guilds, taverns, temples, tombs and many more)\xfeff[u]\n<br />[/u][/list]   \xfeff   \xfeff* [u]Interior Weather[/u] (outdoor weather through doors and windows or through the roof)\n<br />   \xfeff   \xfeff* [u]Service Voices[/u] (comments from service NPCs)[u]\n<br />   \xfeff[/u]   \xfeff\xfeff* [u]Containers[/u] (containers open/close sound)\n<br />[u]   \xfeff[/u]   \xfeff\xfeff* [u]UI[/u] (additional, immersive little sounds)\n<br />   \xfeff   \xfeff\xfeff* [u]PC[/u] (fatigue, health, sickness etc.)\n<br />   \xfeff   \xfeff* [u]Miscellaneous[/u] (little stuff - water splashes, yurt/bearskin door sounds, variable rain and wind sounds, rain on exteriors etc.)\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][color=#ffd966][u]Replacer [/u][/color]- a replacer for some of the \"worst offenders\" amongst MW's original sounds. Aimed at providing a high quality alternative, without straying too far from vanilla experience. Remember to back up the originals. Not required for the mod to work.\n<br />[*]There are also additional replacers for\xa0[url=http://abitoftaste.altervista.org/morrowind/index.php?option=downloads&amp;task=info&amp;id=39&amp;Itemid=50]Animated Morrowind[/url]\xfeff\xa0\x61nd\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46786]Passage of Prayers[/url]. sounds.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />II.\xa0[u][b]Installation[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[/u][u]This mod requires MWSE-Lua[/u] (and thus will not work in OpenMW). Install first using\xa0MGE XE and run the updater.\n<br />\n<br />If you want to use the unsupported and obtrusive previous soundpack, you should download the latest full version anyway. No\n<br /> 1.x.x version will work with 2.x.x or 3.x.x etc.- you have been warned! You can obviously mix and match the sounds themselves, just observe the folder structure and remember to rename the files to be &lt; 32 characters.\n<br />\n<br />III.\xa0[b][u]Compatibility\n<br />\n<br />[/u][/b]Technically compatible with existing sound mods. The result, however, is something you should determine for yourself. I've so far tested it with official BC sounds plugin and it plays along just fine. Replacer file will of course replace original sounds, but it's fully optional. Compatible with all recommended mods listed below.\n<br />\n<br />You can also check out my music mod: [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46312]Better Music System Redone[/url]. Or just play with no music at all.\n<br />\n<br />Works best atmosphere-wise when paired with\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48636]Watch the Skies[/url]\xa0\x61nd\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50517]Vapourmist[/url]\xfeff.\n<br />\n<br />IV. [b][u]How can I customise it?\n<br />[color=#6d9eeb]\n<br />[/color][/u][/b]The bulk of the options are available through in-game MCM menu and a module volume adjuster menu (shift+V by default).\n<br />\n<br />If you want to add your own ambient sounds, then all you need to do is copy over some .wavs. That's it, the mod will randomly select a track from the appropriate folder.\n<br />\n<br />If you feel like editing region-to-climate assignments, open up [b]Data Files/MWSE/mods/tew/AURA/Ambient/Outdoor/outdoorClimates.lua[/b]\xa0\x61nd edit the\xa0table there, according to the scheme. Same for adding regions - you need a region [b]name [/b](NOT the ID!) in square brackets followed by '=' and a climate name.\n<br />\n<br />As an example, you're using a mod that adds a region named \"Big Chungus Fields Region\", which is a huge grassland. What you can do is:\n<br />a) navigate do [b] [b]Data Files/MWSE/mods/tew/AURA/Ambient/Outdoor/outdoorClimates.lua[/b]\n<br />[/b]b) open the file with a text editor (no worries, Notepad is enough, but I recommend Sublime Text, Notepad++ or any IDE of your choice)\n<br />c) enter a new line somewhere in the table and insert the following line (every single character here is important!):\n<br />\n<br />[font=Verdana][color=#d9ead3][\"Big Chungus Fields Region\"]\xa0=\xa0\"Grassy\",[/color][/font]\n<br />\n<br />d) save the file. When your enter the Big Chungus Fields Region in-game, you will hear sounds from the \"g\" folder in [b]Data Files/Sounds/tew/A/C[/b].\n<br />\n<br />As for my own sounds - do whatever you want with them, really. Mix, cut, stretch, reverse, mash - I don't care. I'd be glad to hear feedback, though, so feel free to comment! When it comes to the code, however, please PM me first, or raise a PR if you want to help. I'm on Discord, too.\n<br />\n<br />V.[b]\xa0[/b][u][b]Recommendations\n<br />[/b][/u][list]\n<br />[*][b][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48636]Watch the Skies[/url][/b]\n<br />[*][b][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50517]Vapourmist[/url][u]\xfeff[/u][/b]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49654]CSO[/url]\xfeff\xfeff\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46312]Better Music System Redone[/url]\xfeff\n<br />[*]\xfeff\xfeff[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46338]Spell Sounds Enhanced[/url]\xfeff\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47968]Its a Deal[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47767]Great Service[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Bitter_Coast_Sounds]\xfeff\x42\x43 Sounds[/url]\n<br />\xfeff\xfeff[/list]VI.\xa0[b][u]Credits[/u][/b]\n<br />Hrn for his distance calculation function and confirming my fears of MW's sound engine from his unreleased Interior Weather mod.\n<br />Neoptolemeus for the\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42495]Birds and Crickets[/url]\xfeff.\n<br />Texafornian for[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46229] Provincial Music[/url], from which I borrowed some ideas for sound feed.\n<br />[b]NullCascade[/b], [b]Merlord[/b], [b]Greatness7[/b], [b]OperatorJack [/b]and all of the MW modding community on Discord for information and advice, as well as MWSE development.\n<br />Brazil for lua.
