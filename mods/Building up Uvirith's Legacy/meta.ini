nexusDescription="===============\n<br />1. DESCRIPTION\n<br />===============\n<br />For the Benifit of those who do not read the entire readme: THIS MOD IS INCOMPATABLE WITH BuUG, IT MAY RESULT IN DOUBLING AND OTHER ERRORS.\n<br />This is a BETA attempt to patch together two of the most popular Tel Uvirth Stronghold mods, Uvirith's Legacy(UL) by StuporStar, and Building up Uvirith's\xa0\n<br />grave(BuUG) by Mike \"Acheron\". I Prefer the Interior Changes made by UL, as it's the entire mod, so this modifies the BuUG plugin to conform to UL's\xa0\n<br />Requirements by REPLACING the .esp of BuUG. As previously Stated, this is a BETA, and thus doesn't allow all features to remain. You WILL loose the options\n<br />for a few expansions, namely:The Thone Room(already present in UL), the Jail Cells(already present in UL), The Tinker's Lab(but the Tinker's purpose is now\xa0\n<br />served through Helendrisa), and the Option to have Tela Hamme move into your alchemy nest(for obvious reasons).\n<br />Hlendrisa also includes some LGNPC dialog for LGNPC Tel Uvirith, this does not conflict with the LGNPC project but allows those who do not use it to access\xa0\n<br />some of her background that led to the creation of your centurions. This is by far nicer than paying for a curious tinker when you have a Dwemer genious,\n<br />Helendrisa,housed next to your tower already.\n<br />Edit to the BuUG Readme: Alchemy Nest is now available in another construction. For the exact location, go ALL the way to the bottom(of this readme...) in\xa0\n<br />Notes/Spoilers. The Bloodmoon and Tribunal Alchemy patches are in a seperate folder, sorry everyone, there was no room for Srikandi's ingrediants.\xa0\n<br />I have never heard of them, and am not a fan as \"Acheron\" was. Please make sure the ingrediants .esp's come after BuUL.\n<br />There is now another plugin, Fast Eddie Fix v.0001.esp\n<br />\xa0This will allow you to advance Fast Eddie to Spellwright and build him a tower in your town. This plugin(Fast Eddie Fix) is incompatable with UL, if you\xa0\n<br />are Using UL DO NOT use this plugin.\xa0\n<br />Update: v\xa0 0.9: LGNPC compatable\n<br />   v\xa0 1.0: Fixed error with door to interior, no longer conflicts with vinella game or a stronghold expansion\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\x43reated a WORKING alternative to the Alchemy Nest, all features(i am aware of) have been relocated.\n<br />   v 1.01: Minor bug-fix, You may now sleep within the tower.\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0--- New plugin added that will allow you to advance Fast Eddie to spellwright, DO NOT USE WITH UVIRITH'S LEGACY\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 v 1.1 : Your animuncali can now be fixed through Hlendrisa\n<br />===============\n<br />2. Requirements\n<br />===============\n<br />This mod Requires morrowind and nothing else, it can run without any telvanni stronghold expansion. (you will get the Vinella Stronghold interior)\xa0\n<br />========================\n<br />3. INSTALLING THE PLUGIN\n<br />========================\n<br />First, Download the mod and open the file. Take the \"icons\", \"meshes\",and \"Texture\" folder files, along with the .esp, and place them in the Morrowind Data\xa0\n<br />Files folder.\n<br />Note: you only need to move the .esp if you have previously downloaded BuUG.\n<br />=====================\n<br />4. PLAYING THE PLUGIN\n<br />=====================\n<br />From the Morrowind Launcher, select Data Files and check the box next to the\n<br />(Building Up Uvirith's Legacy 1.01.esp)\n<br />Note: if you previously used BuUG, uncheck it.\n<br />===============\n<br />5. SAVE GAMES\n<br />===============\n<br />As suggested by the Author of BuUG;\n<br />   \"It is best if you start a new game before using this mod since it may conflict with your saved files. If you have an existing saved game that\xa0\n<br />   you want to use with this mod (i.e. if you have an existing Telvanni character) you may want to take these steps:\n<br />   (Note: Perform the following at your own risk, make sure you know what you're doing and back up your saved games)\n<br />   Load your saved game.\n<br />   Save your game in a new file making sure that your character is not in an Uvirith-Related Cell or Shushan. Don't leave your items lying around\xa0\n<br />   these cells either, or they'll be deleted.\n<br />   Exit Morrowind.\n<br />   Open your new saved game using Morrowind Enchanted Editor and delete the three \"Tel Uvirith, Tower\" cells, \"Shushan\" and \"Uvirith's Grave.\" It may\xa0\n<br />   be a good idea to have safe editing turned on as well.\n<br />   Save the file and close Morrowind Enchanted Editor.\xa0\n<br />   Load the modified saved game in Morrowind and return to Uvirith's Grave to start using the mod.\"\n<br />============================\n<br />6. CONFLICTS / KNOWN ERRORS\n<br />============================\n<br />It will conflict with BuUG and any other EXTERIOR mod to Uvirith's Grave. It is completely compatable with any INTERIOR Mod for Uvirith's grave, such as UL,\xa0\n<br />LGNPC Tel Uvirith, and other similar mods.\n<br />================================\n<br />7. CREDITS / PERMISSIONS RECEIVED\n<br />================================\n<br />all credit to Mike \"Acheron\", and many apologies that I could not meet the contact Requirements he requested. My e-mails were never responded to. Consider\xa0\n<br />this mod the completion of a promise (s)he made to Stuporstar.\xa0\n<br />Stuporstar, for the best Telvanni Stronghold I've ever seen.
