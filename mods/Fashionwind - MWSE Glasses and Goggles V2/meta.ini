Argonian's heads are all wildly different in shape so they're off the table. \n<br />-This mod also may have clipping if you use a mod for different heads, however you are able to alter the exact positioning of the eyeware by race in the main.lua file, if you wish to create a compatibility file for a specific head mod I can host it here if you like.\n<br />-If you use a custom race you can add it to the main.lua file and alter the exact positioning of the models if the default position does not suit.\n<br />-This is an MWSE mod so it wont work with openmw\n<br />\n<br />Though I came up with the original idea and made the models myself, none of it would have been possible without\xa0Safebox's incredible scripting wizardry, so extra special thanks to him.\n<br />\n<br />Ideas for the future:\n<br />-a wares version by Danae.\n<br />-an intergrated version that gives glasses to npcs.\n<br />-got any suggestions of your own? let me know in the comments.\n<br />\n<br />Special thanks to:\n<br />Safebox for his support and making the onion framework\n<br />R-zero for his ashgoggles\n<br />Kafeid for making the original alchemists lenses\n<br />Ivolga for porting Kafeid's models\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />All of my mods and assets are free for anyone to use as a resource for what ever you want and free for anyone to translate and host on other sites, as long\n<br />as you give credit.\n<br />If I've made a mistake of some kind, please let me know and I'll do my best to solve it.\n<br />you can keep up to date with me and my workings by following me on\xa0[url=https://twitter.com/RVangarr]this terrible website[/url][url=https://discord.gg/TvQMfUAa]\n<br />\n<br />[/url]"
