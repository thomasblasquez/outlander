This mechanics seems not exactly fitting for my tastes. It's not clear how would an Ash Zombie, clearly distinct creature of Sixth House, managed to infiltrate cities. Moreover it's a missed opportunity to make a more immersive and unique experience. \n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3]Description[/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />With this mod, instead of being attack by an Ash Zombie, you will find yourself in a nightmare influenced by Sixth House. Go through a disturbing and chaotic location and try to find a way out. And if you die in the dream you die for real."
