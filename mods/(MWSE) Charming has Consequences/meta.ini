nexusDescription="Charm is a problematic effect in the vanilla game. Since dialog pauses the game, it's far to easy to trivialize dialog by making a 1 second, max strength charm spell. Many mods that attempt to fix this, such as by increasing the cost of charm, or making the application of charm effects a crime, typically go too far, and make charm nearly unusable.\n<br />\n<br />My solution is relatively simple. Inspired by the mechanics of Charm Person from 5e D&amp;D, I've made an MWSE lua script to add a 30 gold bounty whenever a charm effect wears off. The idea of this is to encourage the player to make long duration charm effects so that they have enough time to get away before the effect ends.\n<br />\n<br />In addition, as of the latest update, I've now added a feature that causes crimes to not be reported if your illusion skill is at or above 100, either through fortification effects or by training the skill directly. This feature can be toggled off in the MCM if preferred.\n<br />\n<br />Configuration\n<br />as of version 1.1, this mod features an MCM menu with a couple of useful options\n<br />[b]Crime Avoidance[/b] - Enables a feature that causes crimes to not be reported if the user has a sufficiently high illusion skill (defaults to on)\n<br />[b]Crime Avoidance Threshold[/b] - If Crime Avoidance is enabled, this slider determines the skill level threshold before crimes stop getting reported (defaults to 100)\n<br />[b]Bounty for Charming[/b] - This\xa0 slider determines how much bounty the player receives from charming an NPC. Accepts values from as low as 5gp to as high as 1000gp. (defaults to 30gp)\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[u][size=4]Recommended Mods[/size][/u][size=4]\n<br />[/size][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47215]MAB0's Exploitable[/url]\xa0 - Allows fortification effects to wear off even while the game is in \"pause mode\" during dialog\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47222]MAB0's Manipulated[/url] - Adds crime reactions for the other manipulation illusion effects, such as Frenzy, Demoralize, Calm, and Rally. ([b]Just make sure to turn off that mods charm reactions if using along side mine[/b])"
