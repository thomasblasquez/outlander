nexusDescription="[img]https://i.imgur.com/9pcKMRX.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b]Update: 1.2.2 is out! Fixes and improvements to perks. Most importantly Bleed damage causing crashes, Werewolf damage is now fixed and will do the same as it did in vanilla.[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b]Please note when updating: [/b]if you already have an [b]ngc.json [/b]with your configuration, an update will overwrite with the new one with new settings. You will either need to set these manually yourself if you choose to keep yours or delete your [b]ngc.json[/b]\xa0\x66ile. It will appear in [b]Overwrite[/b]\xa0in MO2 and can be deleted from there.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[b]Important: [/b][size=3]Requires latest [/size][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/41102]MGE XE[/url][size=3] and the latest\xa0[/size][url=http://nullcascade.com/mwse/mwse-dev.zip]MWSE 2.1[/url][size=3]\xa0(if you already have MWSE installed, run[/size][i]\xa0MWSE-Update.exe [/i][size=3]inside your Morrowind folder to update it to the latest. This is [/size][b]NOT OPTIONAL[/b][size=3], you [/size][b]NEED[/b][size=3] the latest MWSE).[/size]\n<br />[size=5]\n<br />[/size][size=5]Features[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=3]100% chance to hit (this can be toggled off and all other features will still be usable)[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]All attributes and skills in the game are still useful with 100% hit (See below)[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Complete compatibility - no patches needed for weapon, race, NPC mods, etc. (Uses latest MWSE to not require editing records)[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Unique and interesting weapon perks to make combat more interesting (See below)[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Active blocking with fatigue drain and block perks (See below)[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Customizable skill gain for weapons, armor and block (reduced by default to compensate for 100% hit)[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]More fast paced and engaging combat[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Works with ranged weapons[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Everything works for all NPCs and creatures the same, creating a uniform and balanced combat experience[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Creatures have a unique damage scaling formula where the more Strength they have the more damage they do - this makes creatures a little more balanced with all the other changes[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Rebalanced some vanilla fatigue and knockdown (attacks cost slightly more per hit now and knockdown is slightly harder to achieve without much higher damage)[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Fully configurable with MCM UI[/size]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[size=5]Attributes and skills\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][b]Weapon skill[/b] along with the weapon perks every 25 levels (see below), will now give a small damage boost equivalent to 20% extra damage at 100 (0.2% per level).\n<br />[*][b]Fortify Attack[/b] will now give a damage bonus, 1pt is 0.5% more damage. Making Fortify Attack still very valuable!\n<br />[*][b]Sanctuary[/b]\xa0now reduces the damage taken by instead. The more Agility and Luck you have the more effect Sanctuary will have. ([b]Example: [/b]At 50 Agility and 30 Luck, a 30pt Sanctuary spell will give you 5% damage reduction. At 100 Agility and 70 Luck, 30pt Sanctuary is 15% damage reduction)\n<br />[*][b]Blind[/b] will still reduce chance to hit, so you can still miss due to being blinded (you will see a message if you do). But this is far more understandable, if you are blinded, missing at point blank makes more sense. Miss rate at 1% per pt like vanilla, 30 pt Blind will cause someone to have a 30% chance to miss.\n<br />[*][b]Fatigue [/b]will now reduce damage rather than hit chance, this is 20% less at zero fatigue by default.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[size=5]Weapon perks\n<br />[/size]\n<br />Weapon perks give you unique bonuses for each weapon at skill level 25, 50, 75 and 100.\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][i]Short blade\n<br />[/i][/size]\n<br />Short blades are about fast and deadly strikes, they now have a chance to Critical Strike (100% bonus damage) and can execute enemies with fatal damage when the enemy is low on health (&lt;25% HP).\n<br />\n<br />[b]25 - [/b]10% chance to Critical Strike\n<br />[b]50 - [/b]20% chance to Critical Strike\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \xa0[b]\xa0\xa0[/b]\xa0\x35\x30% Execute damage at low health\n<br />[b]75 - [/b]35% chance to Critical Strike\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 100% Execute damage at low health\n<br />[b]100 - [/b]50% chance to Critical Strike\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 150% Execute damage at low health\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][i]Long blade\n<br />[/i][/size]\n<br />Long blades are about precise swift attacks, they now Multistrike on each 3rd hit causing more damage, with a chance to to do double damage on that hit. As well as a chance to Riposte, causing 50% extra damage if you counter attack in time! Counter attack duration is 2 seconds by default.\n<br />\n<br />[b]25 -\xa0[/b]10% bonus damage every on third hit\n<br />[b]50 -\xa0[/b]20% bonus damage every on third hit and 5% chance for double damage\n<br />   \xfeff\x31\x30% chance to Riposte\n<br />[b]75 -\xa0[/b]35% bonus damage every on third hit and 10% chance for double damage\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 15% chance to Riposte\n<br />[b]100 -\xa0[/b]50% bonus damage every on third hit and\xa0\x32\x30% chance for double damage\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 20% chance to Riposte\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][i]Blunt weapon\n<br />[/i][/size]\n<br />Blunt weapons are naturally stronger against armored targets (doing bonus damage on hit the more armor an enemy has) and have a chance to temporarily stun the enemy with their brute force (paralyze the enemy for 1 sec).\n<br />\n<br />[b]25 -\xa0[/b]5% chance to stun\n<br />[b]50 -\xa0[/b]10% chance to stun\n<br />    0.2% bonus damage per point of enemy Armor Rating\n<br />[b]75 -\xa0[/b]15% chance to stun\n<br />    0.25% bonus damage per point of enemy Armor Rating\n<br />[b]100 -\xa0[/b]20% chance to stun\n<br />   \xa0 0.33% bonus damage per point of enemy Armor Rating\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][i]Axe\n<br />[/i][/size]\n<br />Axes will slash and tear the enemy causing bleeding (150% bonus damage over 3 seconds).

It is now a health damage skill like the other weapon skills, while retaining it's identity of knocking down the enemy with hard hits and doing bonus damage when the enemy is knocked down! \n<br />\n<br />The base damage of hand to hand now scales with weapon skill tiers.\n<br />\n<br />Knockdown chance is modified by enemy Agility, from 25% of base chance against very high Agility at a minimum and full knockdown chance at low Agility (&lt;30).\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[b]Important: [/b]Please use the Next Generation Combat - Hand To Hand Sound Fix.esp if you are using Hand to Hand feature.\n<br />\n<br />[b]0 - [/b]2 - 3 base damage\n<br />\n<br />[b]25 -\xa0[/b]3 - 4 base damage\n<br />   \xfeff\x35% chance to knockdown on hit\n<br />   \xfeff\x31\x30% bonus damage to knocked down enemy\n<br />[b]50 -\xa0[/b]5 - 7 base damage\n<br />   10% chance to knockdown on hit\n<br />   10% bonus damage to knocked down enemy\n<br />[b]75 -\xa0[/b]8 - 11 base damage\n<br />   15% chance to knockdown on hit\n<br />   \xfeff\x32\x30% bonus damage to knocked down enemy\n<br />[b]100 -\xa0[/b]11 - 14 base damage\n<br />   \xfeff\xa0 20% chance to knockdown on hit\n<br />   \xa0 \xfeff\x33\x35% bonus damage to knocked down enemy\n<br />\n<br />[i][size=4]Marksman\n<br />\n<br />[/size][/i]Marksman perks are split into weapon types but all based on marksman weapon skill.\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][i]Bow\n<br />\n<br />[/i][/size]Bows favour long range and high damage but require patience, strength and accuracy. They now have the Full Draw ability which requires holding down the attack key for 3 seconds, once in Full Draw your fatigue starts to drain but you large bonus damage.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />If you reach low fatigue, your arrow will be denocked and you will lose Full Draw. Also you move slowly backwards while in Full Draw. If you Full Draw while in sneak, you also get a zoom to better aim at your target.\n<br />\n<br />Finally, every bow hit can hamstring the target reducing movement speed by 50% for 3 seconds.\n<br />\n<br />[b]25 -\xa0[/b]25% bonus damage on Full Draw\n<br />[b]50 -\xa0[/b]50% bonus damage on Full Draw\n<br />   10% chance to Hamstring\n<br />[b]75 - [/b]75% bonus damage on Full Draw\n<br />   15% chance to Hamstring\n<br />[b]100 - [/b]100% bonus damage on Full Draw\n<br />   \xa0 \xa0\x32\x30% chance to Hamstring\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][i]Crossbow\n<br />\n<br />[/i][/size]Crossbows favour short range and do more damage the closer your enemy (bonus damage in critical range of 800 units).

Active blocking will drain fatigue as a percentage of your maximum fatigue, with lower amounts of fatigue drain at higher block levels.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />And you will drop your guard if your fatigue goes below 25% of maximum.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][i]Block[/i][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b]0 - [/b]25% max fatigue drained per second\n<br />[b]25 -\xa0[/b]20% max fatigue drained per second\n<br />[b]50 - [/b]15% max fatigue drained per second\n<br />[b]75 -\xa0[/b]10% max fatigue drained per second\n<br />[b]100 - 5[/b]% max fatigue drained per second\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]Skill experience gain[/size]\n<br />\n<br />Experience gains have been adjusted for an always hit environment, weapon skills scale with weapon tiers and armor skills are a flat modifier.\n<br />\n<br />[i][size=4]Weapon skills including block[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[/i][b]0 - [/b]40% less experience gain\n<br />[b]25 - [/b]35% less experience gain\n<br />[b]50 - [/b]30% less experience gain\n<br />[b]75 - [/b]20% less experience gain\n<br />[b]100 - [/b]vanilla experience gain\n<br />\n<br />[i][size=4]Armor skills\n<br />[/size][/i]\n<br />20% less experience gain\n<br />\n<br />All these values are configurable, see configuration section below.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]Installation[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]To install the mod, extract everything to your Morrowind Data Files folder or use a mod organiser like MO2.\xa0\n<br />[/size]\n<br />Activate both the .esp, they can be anywhere in your load order.
