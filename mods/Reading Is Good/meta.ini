nexusDescription="Reading is good, and characters should be encouraged to read from the very beginning of the game.\n<br />\n<br />In vanilla, skill books give a one-point increase to the associated skill. To get the most out of them, you should save them up, and use them\xa0late in the game to upgrade skills that are already high-level (since such skills cost the most and take the longest to train).\n<br />\n<br />In this mod, skill books no longer give a free skill point. Instead, they permanently increase the XP you gain when training that skill. This\xa0means that players will profit from skill books over the entire game, and will benefit the most from reading skill books as early as possible. You can customize the XP multiplier in the Config Menu. The default setting is 4%, so you can gain up to 120% of vanilla XP from training after reading all five skill books present in vanilla.\n<br />\n<br />You can also customize the Cap in the Config Menu, for skill books added by other mods. By default, there is a 'Hard Cap' set at 5; skill books above the fifth one will have no effect. You can also select a 'Soft Cap' (skill books above the cap will give half of the XP multiplier) or a 'Vanilla Cap' (skill books above the cap will give a single skill point, same as vanilla).\xa0\n<br />\n<br />You can also raise or lower the Cap number itself. To apply your chosen XP multiplier to all skill books, simply change the Cap limit to 100.\n<br />\n<br />Now skill books are valuable from the moment you step off the boat, and characters have reason to proactively seek them out, to read every book as soon as possible.\n<br />\n<br />This mod was directly inspired by '[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42026]Reading Is Good SKSE[/url]' by Parapets, a mod that makes the same changes to Skyrim skill books.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />============\n<br />Changelog\n<br />============\n<br />1.0 - Initial upload\n<br />1.1 - Several hotfixes for the 'Blacklist' tab and 'Current Bonuses' section in the Config Menu. Also, skill books still give the 'level up' music.\n<br />1.2 - Fixed the 'Cap' and made it fully configurable; default set at 'Hard Cap'.\n<br />1.3 - Expanded the sidebar to provide more information about each option. Also, Config Menu now has a header image.\n<br />1.4 - Small fix to ensure the XP multiplier works with skill mods like Nimble Armor.\n<br />2.0 - Fixed a bug with quicksave not clearing skill book data. 'Current Bonuses' now sorts skills by major/minor/miscellaneous, and by specialization (combat = red, magic = blue, stealth = yellow). 'Current Bonuses' also includes a tooltip identifying which skill books contributed to each multiplier.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />============\n<br />Permissions\n<br />============\n<br />This mod was uploaded with the permission of Spammer (aka Ohayo), who wrote the MWSE code for this mod.\n<br />You may freely modify this mod, as long as you credit the original creators (Publicola and Spammer).\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />=============\n<br />Installation\n<br />=============\n<br />Download and install in your preferred mod manager (I use Mod Organizer 2).\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />==================\n<br />Compatibility\n<br />==================\n<br />This is a very straightforward mod, and should be compatible with any mod that adds new skill books.\n<br />If a mod changes how skill books work, this mod is probably incompatible with it."
