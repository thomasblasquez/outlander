nexusDescription="Requires latest MWSE\n<br />\n<br />If you attempt to jump while out of fatigue, you will drop like a rock! Only lasts for a second, but you'll find yourself spam jumping less often ;)\n<br />\n<br />Made with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49870]Mantle of Ascension[/url] in mind. I was unhappy with how easy it was to cheese my way up walls and trees at Acrobatics 5. This change makes the fatigue usage while climbing (and therefore your Acrobatics/Climbing skill) far more important. Does not require Mantle of Ascension, however; you can also use it to curb your bad spam jumping habit!"
