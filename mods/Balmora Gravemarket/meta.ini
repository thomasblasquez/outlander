nexusDescription="[u][b][center][img]https://i.imgur.com/k9m5zQo.png[/img][/center]\n<br />[center]Theme: Flea Market/Wild Goose Chase[/center]\n<br />\n<br />Summary[/b][/u]\n<br />\n<br />The Balmora catacombs were once the vanity project of a particularly pious noble family, one who fell on hard times. Now the Temple rents out the location to House Hlaalu, and a handful of merchants make use of the space with the understanding that the sacred dead are not to be disturbed. To ensure a degree of security for the sacred dead a gravetender has been left as custodian, patrolling and singing hymns.\n<br />\n<br />The various merchants sell a variety of OAAB goods, mainly for decoration purposes; jewellery, gemstones, glassware, silverware, hoods and clothing, various home miscellanea, food and drink, all available.\n<br />\n<br />There is a small starter home for rent, check the notice board for more information.\n<br />\n<br />A previous merchant, now having left under dire circumstances, lost a potently enchanted ring somewhere within the market. [s]Enjoy the wild goose chase, it is well hidden but I did put in two very sparse hints to where it is.[/s]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][u]Requirements\n<br />[/u][/b]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49042]OAAB Data \n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44537]TR Data [/url]\n<br />\n<br />Additionally:[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44537]\n<br />[/url]\xfeff[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49231?]BCOM[/url]\xfeff or[b] [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51011]Nwahs and Mushrooms Balmora[/url] or [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48804]Izis Balmora[/url][u][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48804]\n<br />[/url][/u][/b]For the BCOM version.[b][u]\n<br />\n<br />Credits[/u][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/53679]Greymarch Dawn/Melchior[/url] for the Hlaalu mezanine mesh for the grave pit.\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47135]Welcome Home[/url] By Stormless, which I dismantled to figure out how the player home buying scripts and dialogue worked.\n<br />[url=https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Skylamp?gameId=100]Skylamp[/url] for the alternate waterworks location version."
