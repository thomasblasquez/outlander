A bit boring if you ask me. I hope they don't feel like my brother does, that I dishonor them with my choice in trade. I've written several songs about my ancestor's triumphs and I like to think they're proud of that.[/quote][/center]A Redoran Agent in Ald'ruhn needs your help saving his sister from enslavement.
