The farmer for example has blunt skill and gets a shovel which is a blunt weapon.[/size]\n<br />[/list][list]\n<br />[*][size=3]When a class is particularly wealthy or a great specialist, I gave them a better quality item. For example, the Knight gets a steel long sword, while other classes get an iron saber.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Synergy between classes: classes with H2H and medium armour gets bonemold gauntlets of the Horny first, spellcasters with light armour get a hood, working classes with light armour get a wicket hat, etc.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]I gave a little bit of clutter for some classes: the publican starts with a few bottles, the pawnbroker with bowls and cups, etc.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]I aimed for items and spells worth 300 septims. You make easily that much raiding the Census Office and collecting the freebies (tree stumps!) Bethesda left for you. The goal for me is to be able to start playing my class straight away without having to steal (or being tempted to) a limeware platter.[/size]\n<br />[/list][size=3]\n<br />[b]PERKS\n<br />[/b]As you level up, you can talk to npcs about your abilities and get a new perk, power, or ability. This is directly imported from\xa0\x42\x61lathustrius' Class Abilities. Perls can be abilities (resiances and buffs) or powers and are shared among all classes.\n<br />\n<br />[quote]Highly recommend:\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/56341]Chargen Scenario[/url]\xfeff, the chargen od to end all chargen mods.\n<br /> [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50378]Written in the Stars[/url]\xfeff, the birthsign mod made to complement this mod.[/quote]\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/ESlo2oZ.png[/img]\n<br />Simply use your preferred mod manager or drop into your Data Files folder\n<br />\n<br />[b]Compatible with [/b]\n<br />[/size][list]\n<br />[*][size=3]Any chargen mod[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Compatible with any class mods (some classes will be treated as custom classes if I didn't include them)[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Vituvian Guar's [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49010]Class Starting Spells[/url][/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]AliceL93's [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45832]Guild of Vampire Hunters[/url]\xfeff[/size]\n<br />[/list][size=3]\n<br />[b]Not recommended (though compatible)[/b]\n<br />[/size][list]\n<br />[*][size=3]Tizzo's Useful Starting Spells &gt; you might end up with many spells, a lot of them not tailored to your class.[/size]\n<br />[/list][list]\n<br />[*][size=3]Merlord's Starting gear &gt; you would end up with many items, many doubled because both mods look at your skills to determine your items.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Playable NPC Classes&gt; may result in doubles[/size]\n<br />[/list][size=3]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/jzotB0E.png[/img]\n<br />Merlord for letting me borrow the code from [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47283]Starting Equipment[/url]\xa0\x61nd adding to it so that MWSE skills also taken into account\n<br />Aurel for modifying Merlord's code so that spells can be added as well.\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47958]Pianobadger for his Class mod[/url], I borrowed a lot of classes with his permission.\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47951]Balathustrius' Class Abilities[/url] for the \"ability\" topic and the new perks\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43428]Atrayonis' Playable NPC classes[/url], he was the first to make TR classes playable, I just followed suit.\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46932]Stripes' Moar Classes[/url]\xa0gave me ideas for classes as well.\n<br />[u][b]Not really a credit but worth a mention:[/b][/u]\n<br />[url=https://mw.modhistory.com/download-17-14955]Spuzzum's Starting Equipment[/url], an older mod I liked as well. It gave the player modified vanilla gear to be of lower quality so it is balanced but you had to start the game in Seyda Neen. I took nothing from this mod, but it is a good non-MWSE option for starting gear.\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/40439]Tizzo's Useful Starting Spells[/url]. I've played with this mod for years, a great non-MWSE option.\xa0[/size]"
