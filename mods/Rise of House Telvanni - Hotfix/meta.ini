nexusDescription="This is a heavily expanded version of Pozzo's Rise of House Telvanni (RoHT). This mod adds quests for the Telvanni Archmagister, allowing him/her to gain more political power and strengthen House Telvanni. During RoHT's main quest, the player will decide on House Telvanni's stance towards the Mages Guild and the Twin Lamps, infiltrate the East Empire Company, and shake Vvardenfell's politics to the core.\n<br />Most quests can be played in different styles. Depending on the player's decisions, House Telvanni will gain anything between one and four new strongholds. It is up to the player if House Telvanni rises to political predominance or passes up its opportunities.\n<br />RoHT also introduces some lore about the Telvanni and a chance to reclaim some ancient Telvanni artifacts.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Change log\n<br />Version 1.52\n<br />- Fixed a quest-breaking bug with the door that leads into Mournhold's jail\n<br />- Raised the creatures in Ulaeash from the floor to prevent them from falling through it\n<br />- Simplified interaction with StuporStar's \"Uvirith's Legacy\"\n<br />- Released an updated Compatibility Addon for RoHT and UL as a separate download\n<br />\n<br />Version 1.51\n<br />- The black sheep in RoHT's line of ancestors.
