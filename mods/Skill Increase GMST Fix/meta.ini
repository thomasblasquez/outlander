nexusDescription="[center][size=5][b]Skill Increase GMST Fix[/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/OwTqf4W.png[/img][/center]\n<br />\n<br />This mod fixes several engine bugs related to GMSTs used when raising skills via NPC training and skill books. \n<br />\n<br /> When a skill is raised via practice the following GMSTs are applied: \n<br />If it's a major skill, the game adds iLevelupMajorMult to your progress to next level and iLevelupMajorMultAttribute to your progress toward a level-up multiplier for that skill's governing attribute.\n<br /> If it's a minor skill, it uses iLevelupMinorMult and iLevelupMinorMultAttribute, respectively.\n<br /> Miscellaneous skills don't add to level-up progress, but do add to the attribute multiplier, so they just use iLevelupMiscMultAttriubte [sic].\n<br />\n<br /> Unfortunately, this is not how books and training are implemented. Instead, major skills use iLevelupMinorMult for both level and attribute progress, and minor skills use iLevelupMajorMult for both. Yes, they used the same value twice and got major and minor mixed up.\n<br />\n<br /> Does it matter? [b]If you're playing a straight vanilla game, then it really doesn't and you don't need this mod.[/b] All of the above mentioned GMSTs are 1 by default, so this bug doesn't have any impact on how your character progresses. However, if you want to make or play a mod that tweaks any of these values, you'll see very different behavior between skills that increase via practice and those raised by training or books.\n<br />\n<br />Please review the readme for more details.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Requirements &amp; Installation:[/b]\n<br />[i]Note: This mod uses the pre-release 2.1 branch of MWSE, currently in development.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />This mod requires [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/41102]Morrowind Graphic Extender (MGE-XE)[/url] 0.10.1 or later and the latest nightly build of [url=https://github.com/MWSE/MWSE/releases/download/build-automatic/mwse.zip]MWSE[/url].\n<br />\n<br />To install the mod, extract the archive into your .&#92;Data Files folder.
