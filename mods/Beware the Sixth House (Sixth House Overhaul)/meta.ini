nexusDescription="Beware the Sixth House\n<br />V 3.0.2\n<br />by mort\n<br />\n<br />3.0.2 Fixed ascended sleeper spells and magic level (thanks archslug!)\n<br />3.0.1 Forwarded PFP changes, thanks Sigourn, again!\n<br />3.0 Community rebalance and bugfix patch (mostly thanks to DukoOsshiiKhan)\n<br />2.1 Forwarded Patch for Purists Changes (Thank you Sigourn!)\n<br />2.0 Complete rebalance of the rebalance (wow!)\n<br />1.3 Soundgen fix, ash vampires are no longer hyperspeed\n<br />1.2 re-add keening to Ordos in the combined files, reduce fight to 50 to allow their cool dialogue (this applies to both combined and modular)\n<br />1.1 fix adds the Ash Vampire stats back - thanks Sataniel on MMC discord\n<br />\n<br />Makes the Sixth House the most difficult content in the game. Intended for use with my other rebalance mods.\n<br />\n<br />This makes Dagoth Ur, the Ash Vampires, all Dagoths, all ash slaves, corprus beasts, ascended sleepers and every other corprus beast to be incredibly difficult. They have lots of health. They do lots of damage. Their spells hurt, and some even regenerate health.\n<br />\n<br />V3.0 Changes\n<br />DukoOsshiiKhan on the nexus provided some excellent suggestions and bugfixing ideas that I knew had to be in the mod. Without further ado, version 3.0 of Beware the Sixth House\n<br />\n<br />Bugfixes\n<br />Atronach spam is fixed for Dagoth Endus and Dagoth Ur\n<br />Dagoth Odros no longer has his vanilla stats if you load separate esps\n<br />\n<br />Ash Vampire health is set to 2x vanilla instead of 600 across the board\n<br />All Ash Vampire magicka is generally increased to ensure they cast more spells\n<br />All Ash Vampires are now immune to paralysis, poison, and normal weapons, with 75% immunity to fire (as they are all originally Dunmer)\n<br />All Ash Vampire speed is now 15 (from 10-13)\n<br />All Ash Vampire agility is now 100 (for accuracy and to prevent knockdowns)\n<br />\n<br />Dagoth Odros has reduced spell points, CE 90 sanctuary, and CE chameleon 60, as well as slightly faster speed. You will be forced to use magical attacks to beat him.\n<br />Dagoth Araynys has dispel on self added to his spell, as a sort of anti-magical ward against damage over time and debuffs. He also resists electricity 50%.\n<br />Dagoth Gilvoth is immune to fire and frost, and no longer has 15 speed.\n<br />Dagoth Endus has his conjuration wrath spell removed, it now deals fire damage 3s 5-20 as well as disintegrating armor. However, this is now a radius 3 area spell.\n<br />Dagoth Tureynul has shock damage area 3,3s 10-30 added to his spells, as well as 50% magicka resist, and 50% shock resist.\n<br />Dagoth Uthol has his melee spell now with 40-40 absorb health and magicka, and absorb agility 20-30 for 60s. I would recommend not getting into melee range.\n<br />Dagoth Vemyn has his magicka reduced to 600. His spell effects have been slightly buffed, and his melee attack minimum slightly increased.\n<br />\n<br />Dagoth Ur Changes\n<br />Dagoth Ur Health 900-&gt;1500\n<br />Dagoth Ur Magicka 1500-&gt;3000\n<br />Dagoth Ur Fatigue 500-&gt;1500\n<br />Resist Magicka 50%\n<br />Sanctuary 50%\n<br />Resist Fire 75%\n<br />Immune to paralysis, poison, normal weapons\n<br />All spells except wrath of dagoth removed (to ensure he uses it)\n<br />\n<br />Dagoth Ur Phase 2 Magicka 1000-&gt;5000\n<br />Dagoth Ur Phase 2 Fatigue 1000-&gt;5000\n<br />\n<br />Wrath of Dagoth spell had blind and burden removed, is now\n<br />Damage health 3s 10-50\n<br />Damage fatigue 3s 10-20\n<br />Damage magicka 3s 10-30\n<br />Damage agility 1-10\n<br />Damage intelligence 1-10\n<br />Damage luck 1-10\n<br />Damage speed 1-10\n<br />Damage strength 1-10\n<br />\n<br />Soul Value Changes\n<br />ash vampire soul value 350-&gt;500\n<br />ascended sleeper soul value 350-&gt;450\n<br />ash ghoul soul value 250-&gt;350\n<br />ash zombie soul value 100-&gt;150\n<br />ash slave soul value 100-&gt;150\n<br />\n<br />These changes are applied to named Dagoths who share the same creature type.\n<br />\n<br />Added consistency fixes to the unique corprus stalkers and lame corprus monsters Sigourn performed here\n<br />https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49232\n<br />\n<br />Unused Dagoth Placement\n<br />New esp - Places Dagoth Malan, Dagoth Aladus, and Dagoth Mulis\n<br />Dagoth Malan - Odrosal, Tower\n<br />Dagoth Aladus - Tureynulal, Bladder of Clovis\n<br />Dagoth Mulis - Dagoth Ur, Inner Facility\n<br />\n<br />v2.0 Changes\n<br />So, after some feedback I realized this was maybe a bit too far in the damage sponge / one-shot freakbeast direction. \n<br />Here are the current stats in this patch:\n<br />\n<br />===Generic Enemies===\n<br />\n<br />=Ascended Sleeper=\n<br />-Vanilla-\n<br />300 health\n<br />25-75 melee\n<br />Spells:\n<br />Drain Fatigue 20\n<br />Fire Storm 1-10\n<br />Frost Storm 1-10\n<br />Paralyze 5s on touch\n<br />Shockball 2-40\n<br />\n<br />-BTSH-\n<br />400 health\n<br />25-75 melee\n<br />Immune to paralysis, poison, normal weapons\n<br />small AOE Drain health 15-15 for 5s\n<br />Burden 100 for 20s + 10-40 fire damage\n<br />Paralyze 5s on touch\n<br />\n<br />=Ash Ghoul=\n<br />-Vanilla-\n<br />220 health\n<br />15-45 melee\n<br />Spells:\n<br />2-20 lightning\n<br />3-8 sound\n<br />10 pt shield\n<br />Ash Feast -

This assumes the effect is similar to everyone, at the cost of their mind. The corprus beasts are incredibly resilient according to in-game lore. A single Ash Vampire fought off a brigade of Buoyant Armigers single-handed. This mod makes it so that is probably true.\n<br />\n<br />If you want all of the changes below, load Beware the Sixth House and nothing else. If you want only some of the changes, load the mods you want from the modular folder.\n<br />\n<br />1. Sixth House Rebalance - changes the stats and spells of the 6th house creatures (including Ash Vampires and Dagoth Ur)\n<br />2. Ash Vampire Script Fix (based off the mod by hollaajith) - Killing Ash Vampires now weakens Dagoth Ur\n<br />3. Keening belongs to Odros - Keening is now replaced by a cheap copy. The real Keening is now held by an ash vampire to prevent easy looting.\n<br />4. Sunder and keening hurt on pickup - Wielding the tools grants you a mortal blow, but looting them is okay? This changes it to give you a single tick of damage when you loot them.\n<br />\n<br />Tribunal Rebalance\n<br />https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45713\n<br />\n<br />Bloodmoon Rebalance\n<br />https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45714\n<br />\n<br />Recommended:\n<br />More Deadly Morrowind Denizens by Autumn: https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48745\n<br />I consider this part of my rebalance series, if you use my other ones and say \"hey what about the rest of Morrowind\" - Use this!\n<br />\n<br />Credits:\n<br />Sigourn - bugfixing\n<br />DukoOsshiiKhan - rebalance suggestions\n<br />Dagoth Ur Fix by hollaajith (permissions permit modification)\n<br />https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42239\n<br />edited and cleaned his dagoth ur script fix"
