nexusDescription="[u][b][center]Rational Names[/center][/b][/u]\n<br />\n<br />[b]Summary[/b]\n<br />\n<br />This MWSE-lua mod makes various changes to item names for more convenient inventory sorting, and enables names to exceed Morrowind's limit of 31 characters.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Description[/b]\n<br />\n<br />The primary objective of Rational Names is for items to sort more conveniently in the inventory. This mod is inspired in part by the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/28559]Oblivion mod[/url] of the same name, and by the \"names tweaks\" options for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/22368]Wrye Bash[/url]'s bashed patch, although it goes in a different direction in some respects.\n<br />\n<br />Three basic types of changes are made by this mod:\n<br />\n<br />1. Prefixes: Most object types have prefixes added at the beginning of their names to improve sorting, though these prefixes are hidden by default, so you won't see them in the UI. Weapons now sort by type, and optionally max attack, while armor sorts by weight class, armor slot, and optionally armor rating. Clothing also sorts by slot. Drinks (such as alcoholic beverages) and other \"special\" potions now each sort separately from regular potions, while magic scrolls and non-magic letters/notes each sort separately from regular books. Lights sort by radius (an approximation of brightness) and then by time. Apparatus sort by type and then quality, while other tools (lockpicks, probes and repair items) sort by quality. Finally, keys, propylon indexes and soulgems (and optionally gold) now sort separately from other misc items, with soulgems also sorting by soul capacity.\n<br />\n<br />2. Base Name Changes: In addition to the prefixes, many items have their \"base\" names changed as well. In some cases (such as potions), these changes improve how the items sort in the inventory. In other cases items have more descriptive names, and some groups of items with previously identical names are now named in such a way as to distinguish them from each other. Also, a few names have been lengthened to take advantage of the third basic change made by this mod. The archive includes spreadsheets which list all items whose base names have been changed, along with their old and new names (not including any prefix).\n<br />\n<br />3. Name Length Limit: In vanilla Morrowind, object names cannot be longer than 31 characters, and the game will poop its diaper if we try to set a name longer than that. This limitation is still technically in place, but this mod enables it to be bypassed. The mod keeps track of all objects with names longer than the limit, or whose names should otherwise be displayed differently than their technical object names (such as items with prefixes, when the mod is configured to hide prefixes), and modifies the UI (e.g. in menus) in various places to enable it to display the correct name.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Details[/b]\n<br />\n<br />This mod affects every type of object that you can have in your inventory (though not every individual object is renamed by this mod). Other object types with names (such as creatures, NPCs and spells) are not affected. The changes made to each object type are described below:\n<br />\n<br />[u]Weapons[/u]\n<br />\n<br />Weapon names now have prefixes (hidden by default) at the beginning so they'll sort more conveniently in the inventory. Weapon prefixes include an abbreviation of the weapon type (e.g. \"SB\" for short blade and \"Ax\" for axe), so weapons will sort by type. Also, weapon prefixes distinguish between one- and two-handed variants (e.g. \"LB-1\" and \"LB-2\" for one- and two-handed long blades, respectively), so one- and two-handed weapons of each type will sort together.\n<br />\n<br />In addition, by default the weapon's maximum attack will also be included in the prefix, so, within each type, weapons will sort by attack. This is the weapon's highest max attack among the three attack types (chop, slash, thrust), except for marksman weapons, which only use chop. If you prefer for max attack to not be included in the prefix, this feature can be disabled in the Mod Config Menu, in which case weapons will simply sort alphabetically within each type.\n<br />\n<br />To put all this together, with vanilla stats, the Daedric Longsword is a one-handed long blade with a max attack of 44, so the full name of this object, with prefix, is: \"(W-LB-1-044) Daedric Longsword\". (The \"W\" at the beginning indicates object type, and improves sorting in the magic and magic select menus; this is configurable in the MCM, though keep in mind that by default you won't see prefixes anyway.)\n<br />\n<br />In addition to the prefixes, a few weapons have had their base names changed. This is mostly to give unique weapons unique names, or to fix stylistic annoyances. See the spreadsheet in the archive for a complete list.\n<br />\n<br />[u]Ammunition[/u]\n<br />\n<br />Ammunition items (arrows and bolts) always sort separately from weapons in the inventory, but they're treated the same as weapons. They have prefixes that indicate their type (\"A\" for arrows and \"B\" for bolts), plus optionally their max attack, so, like weapons, they'll sort by type and then attack. A very few ammunition items have had their base names changed for stylistic reasons.\n<br />\n<br />[u]Armor[/u]\n<br />\n<br />Armor pieces, like weapons, have prefixes to improve how they sort in the inventory. Armor prefixes indicate the piece's weight class and armor slot. By default, weight class comes first, then armor slot, so armor will sort by weight class, and then within each weight class will sort by slot. This order can be reversed in the MCM if you prefer for armor to sort first by slot then by weight class.\n<br />\n<br />In addition, armor prefixes optionally include the piece's base armor rating, so within each weight class / armor slot combination, armor will sort by AR. (This feature can be disabled in the MCM if you prefer.)\n<br />\n<br />So, as an example, the Daedric Cuirass is a heavy cuirass with a base AR of 80, so its name with prefix (with default settings) is: \"(A-3-Cu-080) Daedric Cuirass\".\n<br />\n<br />Keep in mind that the armor rating shown in the prefix (if prefixes are shown at all) will usually not match what you see in the object tooltip. The tooltip AR display takes your current armor skill into account, while the prefix indicates the *base* armor rating in the game's data, before it's modified by armor skill.\n<br />\n<br />A number of armor pieces have also seen base name changes. Certain unique items now have unique names, and a few stylistic issues have been addressed. In addition, some armor pieces whose names were shortened or abbreviated in vanilla have seen their names lengthened to take advantage of the new ability to display long names.\n<br />\n<br />[u]Clothing[/u]\n<br />\n<br />Clothing items now have prefixes that indicate the item's clothing slot (e.g. \"Am\" for amulets, \"Be\" for belts). This means clothing will now sort by slot (and then alphabetically within each slot).\n<br />\n<br />A few clothing items have also had their base names changed, generally for stylistic reasons or to take advantage of the ability to display long names.\n<br />\n<br />[u]Potions[/u]\n<br />\n<br />Potion names have been totally revamped from vanilla. Regular potions' names primarily consist of the name of their effect, so potions will sort in the inventory by effect. Additionally, the qualifiers (like \"Bargain\", \"Cheap\" and so on) that indicate potion quality have been tweaked so that, for each effect, potions sort in quality order. (This is basically BTB's potion naming scheme in BTB's Game Improvements.)\n<br />\n<br />Spoiled potions will by default sort with other potions with the same (positive) effect, but there's an option in the MCM that will cause all spoiled potions to group together in the inventory if you prefer.\n<br />\n<br />Most potions do not have a prefix, but prefixes are used to allow certain potions to sort separately from the rest. Drinks (such as alcoholic beverages and Skooma) now sort together at the end of the potions list, while other \"special\" potions (e.g. Heroism Potion, Blood of the Quarra Masters) sort at the beginning of the list.\n<br />\n<br />The changes to potion names have the potential to conflict with mods that change vanilla potions to use different effects. If you're using such mods, you should disable base name changes for potions in this mod - see the configuration and compatibility sections for details. However, [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47129]BTB's Game Improvements (Necro Edit)[/url] is an exception, as that mod includes an optional MWSE component to update the names this mod assigns to affected potions.\n<br />\n<br />[u]Ingredients[/u]\n<br />\n<br />Ingredient names have been mostly left alone by this mod; I thought they were basically fine as they are. The only changes made to vanilla ingredients are that two unique ingredients have been renamed to distinguish them from the regular ingredients they're based on (e.g. \"Tinos Drothan's Raw Glass\"). (Cursed varieties of ingredients are still named identically to their non-cursed counterparts, as you're not supposed to be able to tell the difference.)\n<br />\n<br />[u]Apparatus[/u]\n<br />\n<br />Prefixes are used to make alchemy apparatus sort by type (e.g. alembic, calcinator), and then, within each type, by quality.\n<br />\n<br />[u]Books[/u]\n<br />\n<br />This mod makes a number of changes to book names. The biggest change is that, using prefixes, magic scrolls and non-magic notes/letters now each sort separately from regular books in the inventory. Magic scrolls sort together at the end of the books list, while non-magic scrolls/notes sort at the beginning of the list.\n<br />\n<br />Several other changes have also been made. There is an MCM option to remove the \"Scroll of\" identifier for magic scrolls, as it's no longer necessary with the prefix. Another option causes book sorting to ignore leading \"A\", \"An\" and \"The\" in book names, to make it easier to find a book with a particular title. Book series in which the books did not sort in the correct order (2920 and 36 Lessons of Vivec) have been tweaked so they'll now sort in order.\n<br />\n<br />A few groups of books/scrolls with identical names have been renamed to distinguish each item from each other (most notably the various writs of execution). In addition, a few capitalization and other stylistic issues have been addressed.\n<br />\n<br />Finally, the names of several books that had been shortened or abbreviated to fit within Morrowind's 31-character limit have been lengthened to take advantage of this mod displaying long names in the UI. The book previously known as \"Divine Metaphysics...\" now has a quite lengthy name.\n<br />\n<br />[u]Lights[/u]\n<br />\n<br />Carryable lights have been given prefixes so that they sort by radius (an approximation of brightness), and then by time. By default, sorting order is from highest to lowest radius, and highest to lowest time, so the best lights come first in the inventory (important with the mod [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45747]Torch Hotkey[/url]), but this order can be reversed in the MCM.\n<br />\n<br />A number of lights have also seen their base names changed for better sorting within each radius/time combination. Word order has been changed so lights of similar type (such as candles or lanterns) will sort together. Examples: \"Candlestick Brass\", \"Lantern Paper\".\n<br />\n<br />If you're using any version of the light sources from [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/39605]True Lights and Darkness[/url] (including the \"MWSE Lights\" mod from [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47133]TLAD Necro Edit[/url]), you should disable base name changes for lights in this mod's MCM.\n<br />\n<br />[u]Misc Items[/u]\n<br />\n<br />There is an object type called \"miscellaneous items\" that all sort alphabetically in a single category in the inventory, with different types of misc items all jumbled together in vanilla. There are five types of misc items: keys, propylon indexes, soulgems, gold, and everything else. With this mod, these types of misc items all sort separately in the inventory.\n<br />\n<br />- Keys: All keys have a prefix so they'll sort together at the beginning of the misc item list. In addition, the base names of keys have been revamped. \"Key of\" and similar identifiers have been removed, and word order has been changed as needed so the most important word in the key name comes first, for better sorting. Slave keys start with \"Slave,\" so they'll sort together. You might want to add Shashev's Key (\"key_shashev\") to the base name blacklist, to maintain the intentional reference.\n<br />\n<br />Three different methods are used to detect items as keys. This will cover all vanilla keys, and should also detect almost all keys added by mods, whether they actually open anything or not. (It's possible that an unusually-named mod-added misc item will be wrongly detected as a key, in which case the solution is to add it to this mod's overall blacklist.) Mod-added keys will also be dynamically renamed if needed to (mostly) match the new format for vanilla key names.\n<br />\n<br />In addition to name changes, this mod will optionally set the weight and value of all keys to 0 for consistency (which [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47954]Consistent Keys[/url] also does). This ensures that you can no longer sell some keys for good money while most are valueless. Also, the mod will give all keys the \"isKey\" flag, even keys that don't actually open anything and thus lack this flag in vanilla. This has the benefit of allowing Detect Key effects to detect them. These features can be disabled in the MCM if you prefer.\n<br />\n<br />- Propylon Indexes: These items now have a prefix so they'll sort together in the inventory (right after keys in the misc items list).\n<br />\n<br />- Soulgems: Thanks to prefixes, soulgems not only sort together in the inventory, but they also sort in order of soul capacity.\n<br />\n<br />- Gold: Gold will optionally sort at the end of the misc items list instead of in the middle (this feature can be disabled if you prefer). The various stacks of gold also have the prefix, for consistency, in case you have the mod set to display prefixes.\n<br />\n<br />- Everything else: Other miscellaneous items (mostly clutter) are almost entirely untouched by this mod.\n<br />\n<br />[u]Lockpicks, Probes, and Repair Items[/u]\n<br />\n<br />Thanks to the magic of prefixes, these tools now sort in quality order.\n<br />\n<br />[u]Mod-Added Items[/u]\n<br />\n<br />Most features of this mod are implemented dynamically, which means they'll affect items added by mods just as they affect vanilla items:\n<br />\n<br />- Almost all types of items will have prefixes if applicable, which means they'll sort as this mod intends.\n<br />\n<br />- Mod-added notes and magic scrolls will be detected and will sort separately from regular books.\n<br />\n<br />- The MCM options which affect item names are applied dynamically and will be applied to mod-added items.\n<br />\n<br />- Almost all mod-added keys should be detected as keys, and will sort accordingly. They'll be renamed dynamically, and other mod features that affect keys will be applied to them.\n<br />\n<br />However, there are a few features that are not implemented dynamically and rely on lists of specific objects in data.lua to function. Drinks and \"special\" potions not specifically listed in the data tables will not be detected as such, and will sort with regular potions. Also, item-specific base name changes can only be applied if specified in the data tables. This is likely to be especially noticeable with mod-added potions.\n<br />\n<br />The tables in data.lua include vanilla items and items added by the official plugins. They also include items added by many additional mods, including:\n<br />\n<br />- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44537]Tamriel Data[/url]\n<br />- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42145]Tamriel Rebuilt[/url]\n<br />- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44921/]Skyrim: Home of the Nords[/url]\n<br />- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44922/]Province: Cyrodiil[/url]\n<br />- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49042]OAAB Data[/url]\n<br />- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/37795]Morrowind Rebirth[/url]\n<br />- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49231]Beautiful Cities of Morrowind[/url]\n<br />- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/30205]Morrowind Advanced[/url]\n<br />- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44893]Mines and Caverns[/url]\n<br />- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45616]Tombs Expansion[/url]\n<br />- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47135]Welcome Home[/url]\n<br />- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43544]Darknut's Greater Dwemer Ruins[/url]\n<br />- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48745]More Deadly Morrowind Denizens[/url]\n<br />- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50007]Clothiers of Vvardenfell[/url]\n<br />- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/17379]Morrowind Public Library[/url]\n<br />- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42417]Water Life[/url]\n<br />- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46656]Hunter's Mark[/url]\n<br />- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44650]An Issue of Thrust[/url]\n<br />- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45729]Poison Crafting[/url]\n<br />- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44819]Less Generic Tribunal[/url]\n<br />- A number of [url=http://lgnpc.org/downloads]LGNPC mods[/url]\n<br />\n<br />Items from the above mods should be treated just like all other items as far as this mod is concerned. However, you might notice inconsistencies in item names, and potion sorting, with items added by other mods (though keep in mind that the various name-affecting options in the MCM will be applied universally).\n<br />\n<br />See the \"Modifying the Data Tables\" section for instructions on how to add items from other mods to the lists as needed.\n<br />\n<br />[u]Player-Created Items[/u]\n<br />\n<br />In general, this mod applies to player-created enchanted items (whether self-enchanted or created at an enchanter) just as it does to regular items present in the game's data files. Prefixes will be automatically added to them (don't type one in yourself), so they'll sort just like any other item. Any enabled name-affecting options will also be applied to them.\n<br />\n<br />However, you still can't type more than 31 characters in the name field of the enchanting menu. Also, don't try to start the name of such an item with parentheses. The mod assumes anything in parentheses at the beginning of the name is an errant prefix and removes it (before applying its own prefix later). You also don't need to add the \"~\" prefix when creating a magic scroll.\n<br />\n<br />Other types of player-created items are also affected by the mod, though only a couple of very minor name tweaks are likely to apply to player-brewed potions. The mod should also affect new objects created by other MWSE mods.\n<br />\n<br />[u]UI Changes[/u]\n<br />\n<br />In addition to changing object names, this mod changes various aspects of the UI (menus, etc.) to enable them to display names other than the technical object names (for example, to hide prefixes, or to display names longer than Morrowind's 31-character limit).\n<br />\n<br />Affected parts of the UI include:\n<br />\n<br />- Object tooltips (such as when mousing over an item in the inventory).\n<br />\n<br />- The inventory menu header that displays the name of the equipped weapon.\n<br />\n<br />- The magic menu header that displays the name of the active magic.\n<br />\n<br />- Names of enchanted items in the magic menu.\n<br />\n<br />- The notification area of the HUD that displays the current weapon or magic.\n<br />\n<br />- The \"inventory select\" menu (when choosing an inventory item to assign to a quickslot, choosing an item to enchant or a soulgem to use in the enchanting menu, or selecting ingredients or apparatus in the alchemy menu).\n<br />\n<br />- The \"magic select\" menu when choosing magic to assign to a quickslot.\n<br />\n<br />- The (self-)repair menu.\n<br />\n<br />- The service repair menu.\n<br />\n<br />- The enchanted item recharge menu (which is really just a repurposing of the repair menu).\n<br />\n<br />- Magic effect icon tooltips (in the HUD and magic menu) that list the sources of magic effects.\n<br />\n<br />- Dialogue notification messages that inform you when items have been added or removed from inventory during dialogue.\n<br />\n<br />- Various messageboxes, including:\n<br />\xa0\xa0 - When a tool or soulgem has been used up.\n<br />\xa0\xa0 - When a door or container is unlocked with the key.\n<br />\xa0\xa0 - When you sell an item to a merchant that was stolen from that merchant.\n<br />\xa0\xa0 - When you fail to eat an ingredient.\n<br />\n<br />Most of the above is pretty straightforward, though this is a good place to point out that the current weapon/magic display in the HUD notification area has been changed slightly. Now, whenever you change your currently equipped weapon or active magic, the HUD notification will display *both* your weapon and active magic, whereas in vanilla it would only display the one that was just changed. This was the only way to get it to consistently display the intended names.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Configuration[/b]\n<br />\n<br />The Mod Config Menu has many options for configuring the mod:\n<br />\n<br />[u]General Settings[/u]\n<br />\n<br />- Enable mod: Self-explanatory.\n<br />\n<br />- Set value/weight of keys to 0: If this option is enabled (which it is by default), all keys will have their value and weight set to 0.\n<br />\n<br />In the Construction Set, the value of almost all keys is 300, but only those that don't open anything can actually be sold. This is a consistency change so you can no longer sell a handful of keys for good money while the rest are valueless. Also, two vanilla keys have a weight above 0, which is also lowered to 0 for consistency.\n<br />\n<br />- Set isKey flag for all keys: In vanilla Morrowind, any misc item that is set to open a lock has the \"isKey\" flag set. The major consequences of this are that the Detect Key effect will detect the item as a key, and merchants will refuse to buy the item from you, even if they normally buy misc items.\n<br />\n<br />But there are many keys - slave keys, for example - that aren't technically flagged as keys because they don't open anything. This means that Detect Key won't detect them, and merchants will buy them.\n<br />\n<br />This option flags these items as keys, so they will behave like other keys in these respects. Now Detect Key will detect all keys, including slave keys.\n<br />\n<br />- Change message when unlocking with key: Fixes the messagebox that appears when a door or container is unlocked with the key, so it will use the correct display name of the key. This is made optional for compatibility with any other mods that modify this messagebox or change how the game checks for a key to unlock things.\n<br />\n<br />- Enable logging: Enables extensive logging to mwse.log. Don't enable this unless you're troubleshooting a problem or you want to see a very large (huge, enormous) number of lines in the log.\n<br />\n<br />[u]Prefix Settings[/u]\n<br />\n<br />- Enable prefixes: If this option is turned off, prefixes will be entirely disabled. No prefixes will be added to object names, which means objects in the inventory will mostly sort in the vanilla manner.\n<br />\n<br />- Display prefixes: If this option is enabled, the prefixes added to item names by this mod will be visible in the UI (e.g. in object tooltips and various menus where item names are displayed).\n<br />\n<br />With this option disabled (the default), prefixes will still be added to item names to improve inventory sorting, but they'll be hidden in the UI so you won't see them - you'll only see items' base names (which can still be longer than 31 characters) in the UI.\n<br />\n<br />- Add attack/AR to weapon/armor prefix: This mod adds a prefix to weapon/armor names so they'll sort more conveniently in the inventory. For weapons, the prefix indicates the weapon type (e.g. short blade), and for armor it indicates the weight class (e.g. heavy) and armor slot (e.g. cuirass).\n<br />\n<br />If this option is enabled (which it is by default), the max attack (for weapons) or base armor rating (for armor) will be added to the prefix, so items will sort by attack/AR within each category.\n<br />\n<br />- Sort armor by slot first: Armor prefixes indicate both the weight class and the armor slot of armor pieces. By default (with this option disabled), weight class comes first, then armor slot. This means that all armor pieces of each weight class will sort together, and then, within each weight class, armor will sort by slot.\n<br />\n<br />If this option is enabled, this order will be reversed - armor slot will come first, then weight class. This means that all armor pieces for each slot will sort together, and then, within each slot, armor will sort by weight class.\n<br />\n<br />- Improved armor weight class sorting: With this option disabled, weight class is indicated in armor prefixes by \"L\" for light, \"M\" for medium, and \"H\" for heavy. What these indicators mean is obvious when looking at the prefix, but, since armor sorts alphabetically by weight class indicator, it also results in armor sorting heavy first, then light, then medium - not exactly the ideal order.\n<br />\n<br />If this option is enabled, weight class will be indicated by \"1\" for light, \"2\" for medium, and \"3\" for heavy. This means armor will sort in a more rational order, but if you have the mod configured to display prefixes in the UI, the meaning of the weight class indicators will not be obvious.\n<br />\n<br />- Add object type indicator to prefixes: If this option is enabled, an element will be added to the beginning of prefixes for certain object types indicating the object type.\n<br />\n<br />This will cause items of these types to sort together in the enchanted items lists in the magic and magic select menus - armor first, then clothing, then weapons (with scrolls at the end). This will not affect sorting elsewhere, such as in the inventory, container, and inventory select menus.\n<br />\n<br />- Sort lights in reverse order: If this option is enabled, lights will sort in order from brightest to least bright, and then from most to least time. This is handy with the mod [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45747]Torch Hotkey[/url], which equips the first light in your inventory. The downside of this is that, if the mod is configured to display prefixes, the numbers in light prefixes won't particularly make sense.\n<br />\n<br />If this option is disabled, lights will instead sort from least bright to brightest, and then from least to most time (and the numbers in the prefixes will be the actual radius and time values).\n<br />\n<br />- Misc item prefix options: There are options here that allow you to disable prefixes for keys, soulgems and propylon indexes separately. This way you can disable prefixes for one of these item types without disabling them for all misc items below.\n<br />\n<br />- Move gold to end of misc items: Since gold is a misc item, and misc items sort alphabetically, gold sorts in the middle of the misc item list.\n<br />\n<br />If this option is enabled (which it is by default), the name of the \"Gold\" item will have a prefix so it will sort at the end of the misc item list. The various stacks of gold will also have this prefix, for consistency.\n<br />\n<br />[u]Base Name Settings[/u]\n<br />\n<br />- Enable base name changes: If this option is turned off, base name changes will be entirely disabled, though prefixes will still be added to item names if applicable.\n<br />\n<br />- Use Roman numeral potion suffixes: By default (with this option disabled), potion suffixes use BTB's naming scheme so that potions of the same effect will sort in quality order (Bargain, Cheap, Normal, Quality, Special).\n<br />\n<br />If this option is enabled, Roman numerals will be used instead (I, II, III, IV, V).\n<br />\n<br />- Alternate names for spoiled potions: This mod renames potions so that they sort by effect. By default (with this option disabled), spoiled potions sort along with other potions of the same (positive) effect.\n<br />\n<br />If this option is enabled, spoiled potions will instead sort with each other.\n<br />\n<br />- Remove \"Scroll of\" from magic scrolls: Self-explanatory.\n<br />\n<br />- Book sorting ignores articles at beginning: If this option is enabled, articles (\"The\", \"A\", \"An\") at the beginning of book names will be ignored when it comes to inventory sorting. This makes it easier to find a specific book in the inventory.\n<br />\n<br />- Change base names of keys: By default (with this option enabled), this mod renames keys so they'll sort more conveniently in the inventory. The word \"key\" is removed, and word order is rearranged so that the most important word comes first.\n<br />\n<br />If this option is disabled, the base names of keys will not be changed. This allows you to disable base name changes for keys only, without disabling them for other types of misc items. Note that disabling this setting will not remove the prefixes from keys, so keys will still sort together in the inventory.\n<br />\n<br />- Add \"Key, \" to beginning of key names: This mod normally removes the word \"Key\" from key names, because it's usually obvious when an item is a key. This option allows you to add it back, but at the beginning for consistency.\n<br />\n<br />- Names tweak options: These options dynamically make various tweaks to object base names. Options include:\n<br />\n<br />Dwarven -&gt; Dwemer\n<br />Long Bow -&gt; Longbow\n<br />Short Bow -&gt; Shortbow\n<br />Long Spear -&gt; Longspear\n<br />Battle Axe -&gt; Battleaxe\n<br />War Axe -&gt; Waraxe\n<br />Tower Shield -&gt; Towershield\n<br />\n<br />[u]Component Settings[/u]\n<br />\n<br />- Component overall enable settings: There's a setting here for each component of the mod (i.e. for each object type affected by the mod). These settings allow you to disable all changes for particular object types. For example, if you disable the weapons component, the mod will make no changes to weapons. No prefixes, no base name changes, no nothing.\n<br />\n<br />- Component prefix enable settings: These settings allow you to disable prefixes for specific object types, while keeping base name changes for those object types.\n<br />\n<br />- Component base name enable settings: These settings allow you to disable only the mod's base name changes for particular object types. For example, if you disable base name changes for armor, no armor pieces will see their base names changed, though armor will still have prefixes.\n<br />\n<br />[u]Blacklists[/u]\n<br />\n<br />- Overall blacklist: This is a separate page, or tab, in the MCM that can be used to blacklist specific items. Any items added to this blacklist will not be touched by the mod at all. No prefixes, no base name changes, no nothing. Any items potentially affected by the mod can be added to this blacklist if desired.\n<br />\n<br />By default, this blacklist contains two unique Bloodmoon items that are technically keys, but aren't really keys and shouldn't sort with keys.\n<br />\n<br />- Prefix blacklist: Any items added to this blacklist will not have prefixes added by this mod, though might still see their base names changed. This blacklist is empty by default.\n<br />\n<br />- Base names blacklist: Items in this blacklist will not have their base names changed (though they'll still have prefixes if applicable). This can be useful when playing with a mod that changes vanilla items such that the new base name assigned by this mod is no longer accurate.\n<br />\n<br />This blacklist is empty by default, though you might want to blacklist \"key_shashev\" to maintain the intentional reference made by the developers.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Known Issues[/b]\n<br />\n<br />There are a few very minor known issues with this mod.\n<br />\n<br />[u]Failed Quick Equip Messagebox[/u]\n<br />\n<br />When you attempt to use one of the quick keys (1-9) to equip an item or magic (enchanted item), but you no longer have the item in question in your inventory, a messagebox will appear that includes the name of the item. This messagebox will display the technical object name, not the correct display name for the item (e.g. it will show the item's prefix even if the mod is set to not display prefixes generally).\n<br />\n<br />Unfortunately, the display of the object name here is hardcoded and I'm not able to affect it.\n<br />\n<br />[u]Max Attack in Weapon Prefixes[/u]\n<br />\n<br />There's one minor quirk with the max attack display in weapon prefixes: under a certain circumstance, it might not match up with what you see in the object tooltip. If you're using [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46071]UI Expansion[/url], and you have the \"always use best attack\" setting enabled in Morrowind options, the tooltip will only display the attack type that the game considers the best, but that's not necessarily the one with the highest max attack. For example, the vanilla attack stats for a Steel Longsword are as follows:\n<br />\n<br />Chop: 2-14\n<br />Slash: 1-20\n<br />Thrust: 4-18\n<br />\n<br />The highest max attack for this weapon is 20, so its name with prefix is: \"(W-LB-1-020) Steel Longsword\". However, Morrowind considers thrust to be this weapon's best attack, not slash, even though slash has the highest potential damage. This is because thrust has the highest *average* attack, or the highest midpoint between min and max. If you have \"always use best attack\" enabled, and you're using UI Expansion, the tooltip will only display the stats for the thrust attack type (with a max attack of 18), but the prefix, if you've configured this mod to show prefixes, will display 20, because that's the weapon's overall highest max attack.\n<br />\n<br />[u]Magic Effect Icon Tooltips[/u]\n<br />\n<br />There is a potential - though unlikely and in any case minor - issue related to magic effect icon tooltips. This refers to the tooltips that appear when you mouse over the magic effect icons in the HUD or at the top of the magic menu, which display the sources for that effect affecting the player.\n<br />\n<br />These tooltips are more complicated (for the purposes of this mod) than other elements of the UI, and, for technical reasons, the code that forces them to show the correct display name (for long names, or to remove prefixes) is not guaranteed to work in all cases.\n<br />\n<br />There are two specific circumstances that can be problematic, though you shouldn't encounter these with vanilla items: when an enchanted item has \" (\" (a space followed by an open parenthesis) in its name, or when two enchanted items have identical object names (including any prefix) but different display names. In these cases, the names of these objects might display incorrectly in the tooltip.\n<br />\n<br />A similar issue can actually happen with dialogue notification messages (when an item is given to or taken from the player in dialogue), for items whose name begins with a number. You're very unlikely to see this.\n<br />\n<br />[u]Equipped Items Changing on Making Certain Config Changes[/u]\n<br />\n<br />There's a rarely-seen glitch in Morrowind that can occur when you load a savegame and the items in your inventory are in a different order than they were when the savegame was saved. When this happens, Morrowind gets confused regarding what items you have equipped, and it's possible that equipped items will be unequipped (and possibly different items equipped in their place).\n<br />\n<br />You'll generally never see this glitch when using this mod. However, the glitch can be triggered by saving your game, changing MCM settings that affect inventory sorting (e.g. disabling or enabling prefixes), then quitting and reloading. It'll only happen once when you change your settings and items are renamed again. You can avoid the glitch by removing all your equipment before changing any settings that affect sorting. If it happens, though, just re-equip your stuff and save again, and you're golden.\n<br />\n<br />It's also possible this glitch will be triggered on installing the mod for the first time, if installing mid-playthrough. Again, this will only happen once, you can avoid it by unequipping your stuff before installing, and, if it does happen, you'll just need to re-equip your stuff again and you're good to go.\n<br />\n<br />[u]Removing Default Entries from a Blacklist[/u]\n<br />\n<br />Due to the way this mod handles fetching its config settings, it's not possible to remove default entries from the mod's blacklists (the alternative is worse). Items that you add to a blacklist yourself can be removed - it's only items that are on a blacklist by default that can't be removed from it.\n<br />\n<br />Only one of the blacklists (the overall blacklist) has default entries, and I can't think of a reason to remove that blacklist's two default entries (they're items that are technically keys but aren't really keys and shouldn't be treated as keys - removing them would mean they're given the key prefix and sort with keys).\n<br />\n<br />[b]Installation[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Use a mod management tool such as [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45439]Wrye Mash[/url], or just copy the MWSE directory to your Data Files directory.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Requirements[/b]\n<br />\n<br />This mod requires [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/41102]MGE XE[/url] and the latest version of MWSE 2.1. Just install MGE XE and run MWSE-Update.exe to download the latest build.\n<br />\n<br />In particular, this mod requires a recent MWSE build, as it takes advantage of a few recent updates/fixes to MWSE. The build date must be at least 2021-07-08. Just update to the latest version and you're good to go.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Compatibility[/b]\n<br />\n<br />This mod changes the names of various objects, and modifies certain aspects of the UI to force it to display names other than the actual object names. It should be compatible with most mods.\n<br />\n<br />[u]Mods that Change Vanilla Items[/u]\n<br />\n<br />There is the potential for conflicts with any mod that changes vanilla items such that this mod's assigned base names are no longer accurate. In such cases, you might need to add items to the base name blacklist, or even disable base name changes entirely for certain item types. This is particularly likely to happen with mods that change the effects of vanilla potions.\n<br />\n<br />However, [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47129]BTB's Game Improvements (Necro Edit)[/url] is an exception; BTBGI is fully compatible, as it includes an optional MWSE component that updates the base names assigned by this mod to be accurate with BTBGI.\n<br />\n<br />If you're using any version of the light sources from [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/39605]True Lights and Darkness[/url], you should disable base name changes for lights in this mod's MCM (you can keep prefixes for lights), because TLAD makes its own changes to light names that are more accurate with that mod enabled. If you're using the TLAD Lights mod included with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47133]TLAD Necro Edit[/url], disable base name changes for lights in Rational Names MCM, and then set the names setting of TLAD Lights to your preference.\n<br />\n<br />[u]UI Mods[/u]\n<br />\n<br />Care has been taken to ensure that this mod is compatible with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46071]UI Expansion[/url]. However, this mod does touch several aspects of the UI, and it's possible that other MWSE mods that also change the same menus, etc., will conflict, though I'm not currently aware of any.\n<br />\n<br />A more minor issue can arise with MWSE mods that display item names in contexts in which the vanilla game does not, such as mods that create new menus. Such mods will normally display only the technical object names, not the correct display name (e.g. removing prefixes). As a specific example, [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46708]Quick Loadouts[/url] displays item names in its MCM; prefixes will display here even if Rational Names is configured to hide prefixes, and only the first 31 characters of names will show.\n<br />\n<br />The way to fix this is to convince the authors of those other mods to use this mod's interop functionality to get and display the correct names of items in their mods. See the \"interop\" section for details.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Alternatives / Similar Mods[/b]\n<br />\n<br />There are a few other mods that do something similar to what this mod does: rename items for better inventory sorting.\n<br />\n<br />Probably the most similar is [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50018]Better Sorting Names[/url], an MWSE mod that covers multiple object types, like this mod. It makes different decisions in several respects than this mod does, and does not use prefixes to improve sorting. It also can add badges to potion icons. Both mods are configurable, so it's possible to use both and pick and choose which aspects of the mods you want to use.\n<br />\n<br />Another alternative is [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48718]Better Sorted Inventory[/url], which is a plugin mod with a wide scope, renaming objects of many types. It's possible to use that mod together with this one, though, in the case of items in this mod's base name tables, this mod will override the other one. You could address this by adding items to the base name blacklist as needed.\n<br />\n<br />There are also [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47954]Consistent Keys[/url], [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49853]Potion Renamer[/url], [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49861]Soulgem Renamer[/url] and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49941]Propylon Index Renamer[/url], which only cover specific types of items. If you prefer the way one of these mods handles a particular category of item, you could disable the relevant portion of this mod and use the other mod instead.\n<br />\n<br />Two features this mod has, that (at least at this time, as far as I'm aware) no other mod does, are the ability to display long item names (longer than 31 characters), and to use prefixes to improve item sorting while hiding those prefixes in the UI.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Modifying the Data Tables[/b]\n<br />\n<br />It's possible to directly modify the data tables in data.lua to adjust how this mod renames items. Note that this is an advanced method of tweaking the mod, and I recommend that you understand what you're doing before diving in. I also suggest ensuring you have a backup of data.lua before making any changes.\n<br />\n<br />The most obvious way of tweaking the tables is modifying the various \"baseNames\" tables. The file contains separate tables for each object type (at least each object type with item-specific base name changes), listing the IDs and new base names of each object affected.\n<br />\n<br />There's not much point in *removing* entries from these tables, since you could just add the items to the base name blacklist instead. But you can modify existing entries and change the base names to your preference. This could also be done for compatibility with mods that change vanilla items (like potions) such that this mod's assigned base names are no longer correct.\n<br />\n<br />You can also add new entries to the tables. This could be especially useful to rename mod-added items for consistency with this mod's changes to vanilla items, though you could also rename additional vanilla items if desired. Be sure any new entries use the exact same format as existing entries in the tables:\n<br />\n<br />    [code][\"id\"] = \"name\",[/code]\n<br />\n<br />Also, note that the IDs in the tables are all lowercase. The mod's code converts object IDs to lowercase before comparing them to the tables, so be sure any new IDs you add to the tables are also in lowercase or they won't work (the actual objects in the CS don't need to have lowercase IDs, but the table keys do).\n<br />\n<br />You can also add items to some of the mod's other tables. For example, if you're using a mod that adds new drinks and you want them to sort at the end of the potions list along with vanilla drinks, you can add them to the drinksList table. Adding mod-added keys to the keyList table should usually not be necessary, unless they're not being detected as keys (almost all mod-added keys should be detected as such).\n<br />\n<br />Again, be sure to use the exact same format as existing entries:\n<br />\n<br />    [code][\"id\"] = true,[/code]\n<br />\n<br />And, again, be sure that all IDs in the tables are in lowercase.\n<br />\n<br />One other thing you could do is modify the abbreviations for various weapon types, armor/clothing slots and armor weight classes. If you don't like the abbreviations this mod uses for those things, you can change them. This can be used to change how items sort (for example, to change the sorting order of clothing by slot - remember it's alphabetical), or just if you have the mod set to display prefixes and want to change them for aesthetic reasons.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Interop[/b]\n<br />\n<br />It's also possible for MWSE mod authors to interface with this mod and do various neat and useful things.\n<br />\n<br />To establish the interface, do something like this:\n<br />\n<br />[code]local rationalNames = include(\"RationalNames.interop\")\n<br />\n<br />if rationalNames then\n<br />    -- do stuff\n<br />end[/code]\n<br />\n<br />(The nil check is needed because include will return nil if the file is not present.)\n<br />\n<br />The interop file has access to data.lua, config.lua, and common.lua. For example, rationalNames.data gives you access to the tables in data.lua, which can be modified as desired. There are two basic useful things you can do with the interop functionality.\n<br />\n<br />The first is to modify this mod's data tables. You can do anything described in the \"Modifying the Data Tables\" section on the fly via lua. For example, to add new entries to the weapons base names table, you could do something like:\n<br />\n<br />[code]rationalNames.data.baseNames[tes3.objectType.weapon][\"id1\"] = \"name1\"\n<br />rationalNames.data.baseNames[tes3.objectType.weapon][\"id2\"] = \"name2\"[/code]\n<br />\n<br />Of course you could make this more efficient if you're adding a large number of entries. Just don't do this:\n<br />\n<br />[code]rationalNames.data.baseNames[tes3.objectType.weapon] = {\n<br />    [\"id1\"] = \"name1\",\n<br />    [\"id2\"] = \"name2\",\n<br />}[/code]\n<br />\n<br />unless you really intend to totally replace this mod's table with your own.\n<br />\n<br />You can also modify existing table entries, add new entries to the various \"lists\" tables (like drinksList), and make any other changes you desire.\n<br />\n<br />Keep in mind that all object IDs as table keys must be lowercase, as the code converts IDs to lowercase before checking the tables. Also keep in mind that Rational Names renames objects on initialized, at priority -100, so if you want to modify the data tables you'll need to do so before then.\n<br />\n<br />See [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47129]BTB's Game Improvements (Necro Edit)[/url] for an example of the interop functionality being used in this way.\n<br />\n<br />The second thing you can do is get the mod's display name for any object, like this:\n<br />\n<br />[code]local displayName = rationalNames.common.getDisplayName(\"id\")\n<br />[/code]\n<br />\n<br />If your mod displays object names in a context in which the vanilla game does not, you can use this to show the correct display name for an object. You don't need to check how the player has configured Rational Names (though you can, with rationalNames.config, if you need to for some reason); this function does that for you and returns the name with or without prefix depending on configuration.\n<br />\n<br />Note that, if the object's display name given the mod's current configuration does not differ from the actual object name, this function returns nil, so you'll need to get the object name yourself in that case.\n<br />\n<br />Like in the data tables, all IDs passed to this function need to be in lowercase. Also, the tables the function checks are populated on initialized at priority -100, so there's no point in calling this function until after that. You could also add new entries directly to the \"displayNames\" tables in rationalNames.data to make this mod display them, though it's generally better to just change the baseNames tables.\n<br />\n<br />You could also do a reverse ID lookup by object name if needed, like this:\n<br />\n<br />[code]local id, displayName = rationalNames.common.getDisplayNameFromObjectName(\"Object Name\")\n<br />[/code]\n<br />\n<br />Note that this function returns nil if the object doesn't have a display name different from it's object name, and that the returned ID is in lowercase.\n<br />\n<br />See [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47813]Clothing/Equipment Requirements[/url] for an example of this kind of interop usage.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Version History[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Version 2.0.5 - 2021-08-23\n<br />\xa0\xa0 - Fixed a bug where objects created by other MWSE mods on initialized could end up with the wrong name under certain circumstances.\n<br />\n<br />Version 2.0.4 - 2021-08-23\n<br />\xa0\xa0 - Reverted the \"fix\" made in 2.0.1 related to removing default entries from a blacklist, so it's no longer necessary to include a copy of the default config file in the archive (and config settings won't get reverted to default when you update the mod).\n<br />\xa0\xa0 - As a consequence of the above, removed Shashev's Key from the default base name blacklist, so players can still control whether or not it's blacklisted.\n<br />\xa0\xa0 - Fixed an oversight where the messagebox that appears when you try to sell to a merchant an item stolen from that merchant showed the technical object name instead of the correct display name.\n<br />\xa0\xa0 - Fixed a similar oversight regarding the messagebox that appears when you fail to eat an ingredient (though this would almost never have been an issue anyway because ingredients don't have prefixes).\n<br />\xa0\xa0 - Potions from the mod Poison Crafting are now renamed consistent with vanilla potions (thanks to cloxx3 for these).\n<br />\n<br />Version 2.0.3 - 2021-08-20\n<br />\xa0\xa0 - Added options to disable prefixes for keys, soulgems and propylon indexes separately. This allows you to disable prefixes for one of these types of items without disabling them for all misc items.\n<br />\xa0\xa0 - Added option to add \"Key, \" to the beginning of all key names.\n<br />\xa0\xa0 - Fixed an oversight where the messagebox that appears when you unlock a door or container with the key would display the wrong key name. (Thanks to NullCascade for the magic code for this!)\n<br />\n<br />Version 2.0.2 - 2021-08-14\n<br />\xa0\xa0 - Changed the option to remove articles from the beginning of book names: it now affects only object names. This means you'll still see the article in the tooltip, but the book will sort as though the article weren't there.\n<br />\xa0\xa0 - Fixed an issue in the enchanting menu where the name initially pre-filled in the name field when you selected an object to enchant was truncated when it didn't need to be (or more than it needed to be).\n<br />\n<br />Version 2.0.1 - 2021-08-13\n<br />\xa0\xa0 - Fixed a bug where it was not possible to remove default items from a blacklist.\n<br />\n<br />Version 2.0 - 2021-08-12\n<br />   - Added option to hide prefixes so you won't see them in the UI (though they're still technically part of the object names, and so will change how items are sorted in inventory).\n<br />   - Player-created enchanted items are now affected by the mod: prefixes will be automatically added, and all the mod's settings and tweaks will apply.\n<br />   - Added prefixes to apparatus, lockpicks, probes, and repair items, so they'll sort by type (in the case of apparatus) and quality.\n<br />   - Soulgem prefixes now include soul capacity, so they'll always sort in capacity order.\n<br />   - Lights now sort by radius (an approximation of brightness) and then time, with an option to sort in reverse order.\n<br />   - \"Special\" potions that aren't drinks now sort at the beginning of the potion list.\n<br />   - Nearly all keys added by mods should now be detected as keys, even if they don't open anything, and will be renamed to match the format of other key names in almost all cases.\n<br />   - Added option to give all keys the \"isKey\" flag, including ones that don't open anything, so they'll be detected by Detect Key (and merchants won't buy them).\n<br />   - Added items to the data tables from many mods.\n<br />   - Items with names like \"X of the Y\" (and similar) now sort correctly while displaying correct capitalization.\n<br />   - Added options to disable prefixes and base name changes entirely.\n<br />   - Added options to disable prefixes for individual object types.\n<br />   - Added a prefix blacklist to allow disabling prefixes for individual items.\n<br />   - Added option for improved armor prefix weight class indicators, so armor will sort in a more rational order (light-medium-heavy).\n<br />   - Added option for object type indicators in certain prefixes, to improve sorting in magic and magic select menus.\n<br />   - Added an option to disable base name changes for keys without disabling them for other types of misc items.\n<br />   - Added options to tweak base names in various ways (all of which are done dynamically, so they affect items added by mods).\n<br />   - Removing articles (the, a, an) from the beginning of book names is now optional, and is done dynamically.\n<br />   - Removing \"Scroll of\" from the beginning of magic scroll names is now optional, and is done dynamically.\n<br />   - Roman numeral quality suffixes for potions are now optional (without them, BTB's naming scheme for potions will be used).\n<br />   - Removed option to only use two digits for attack/AR in weapon/armor prefixes (not needed with the ability to display long item names and to hide prefixes).\n<br />   - Fixed an oversight where dialogue notification messages (shown when an item is added to or removed from your inventory as part of dialogue \"result text\") displayed the technical object name, not the correct display name.\n<br />   - Fixed an oversight where the messagebox that shows when you use up a lockpick, probe, repair item, or soulgem would contain the object name, not the correct display name.\n<br />   - Fixed a bug where the max attack portion of the prefix for marksman weapons could be incorrect under unusual circumstances.\n<br />   - Fixed a bug where, if the player was under enough magic effects that multiple rows of magic effect icons appeared in the HUD, the sources for effects in rows other than the first would not display the proper names.\n<br />   - Several additional items whose names were shortened to fit within the game's 31-character limit now have their full intended names.\n<br />   - Reverted the change made by 1.0 where identifiers like \"Amulet of\" were removed from clothing names (because removing them doesn't work well with prefixes hidden).\n<br />   - Reverted almost all base name changes for apparatus, lockpicks, probes, and repair items, as they're no longer needed to make them sort by quality.\n<br />   - Soulgems now use a slightly modified version of the vanilla names, as the Roman numeral suffixes are no longer needed to make them sort by capacity.\n<br />   - The \"Barrier\" scrolls now sort in order.\n<br />   - \"Ice Armor\" has been renamed to \"Stalhrim\".\n<br />   - Made a few other tweaks to base names.\n<br />   - The Fake Soulgem (used in a Mages Guild quest) no longer sorts with soulgems, and the Old Man's Lucky Coin no longer sorts with gold.\n<br />   - Added interop file so mod authors can more conveniently interface with this mod.\n<br />   - Various MCM and coding improvements.\n<br />\n<br />Version 1.0 - 2021-07-01\n<br />   - Initial release.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Thanks[/b]\n<br />\n<br />This mod was inspired in part by Wrye's [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/28559]Rational Names[/url] for Oblivion, and by the \"names tweaks\" options for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/22368]Wrye Bash[/url]'s bashed patch.\n<br />\n<br />Thanks to Hrnchamd for tweaking/fixing MWSE for me no fewer than three times during the making of this mod.\n<br />\n<br />Thanks also to NullCascade for the magic code addressing the messagebox when a door or container is unlocked with the key.\n<br />\n<br />Also, NullCascade's [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46071]UI Expansion[/url] taught me how to do a few things in the UI.\n<br />\n<br />Thanks to cloxx3 for the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45729]Poison Crafting[/url] entries in the potion base name table.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Contact[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Feel free to contact me on the Nexus with any comments or suggestions.
