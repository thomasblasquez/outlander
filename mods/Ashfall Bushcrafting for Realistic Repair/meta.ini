nexusDescription="Adds a Stone Anvil and Stone Prongs to Ashfall's bushcrafting menu that allows you to repair your equipment with Realistic Repair. Both recipes unlock at Armorer 25 (Apprentice).\n<br />\n<br />To craft the Stone Anvil, you must have a high enough Bushcrafting level to craft a Workbench, as well as a hammer, chisel, and 15 stone. The recipe is located in the Workbench crafting menu, so can only be crafted in the wilderness.\n<br />\n<br />To craft the Stone Prongs, you also need a hammer and chisel, as well as 2 stone and 3 wood. The recipe is located in the Chisel crafting menu, activated by equipping a chisel, so it may be crafted anywhere. The prongs will only work at a forge, which is\xa0[u]currently[/u]\xa0not craftable, so you will need to find one to use the prongs.\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47461]Corsair's Realistic Repair Add-on[/url]\xfeff\xa0is recommended to add more repair stations to the game world.\n<br />\n<br />Thanks to Merlord for Ashfall, CraftingFramework AND Realistic Repair. Every mod this one connects together is his! As well for his help in creating this mod. Anvil model is from Tamriel_Data, just retextured. Prongs are a retexture of the vanilla Repair Prongs asset."
