Hold LMB to raise shield (active block)[/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />\xa0\n<br />[b]Shield Block[/b]\n<br />Shield Block Chance = Base * Stamina Ratio * Angle Ratio - Attack Ratio\n<br />Base = Block Skill/2 + Agility/5 + Luck/10\n<br />* 125% if the Block perk is taken\n<br />+50 or 100 with the Block perk - only for a player in active block mode (hold swing)\n<br />+ 100 - for everyone except the player\n<br />Stamina coefficient is a linear interpolation from 30% (or 60% with the Block perk) to 100% depending on % stamina\n<br />Angle coefficient = 1 - gaze deviation to the attacker / maximum angle\n<br />* 150% if Block's signature perk is taken\n<br />The angle factor cannot be lower than 0 or higher than 1.\n<br />Max Right Side Angle = 20 (or 30 for active lock mode)\n<br />Max left side angle = 60 (or 30 for active lock mode)\n<br />Max angle is multiplied by 150% if Block's signature perk is taken\n<br />In simple words. Want to successfully block? So take the trouble to turn to the enemy with a shield, and not with an ass.\n<br />Attack Ratio = Weapon Skill/2 + Agility/5 + Luck/10\n<br />* (100% or 125% with Agility perk) + 100% - % Attack Swing\n<br />Heavy attacks are slower and easier to block than fast attacks.\n<br />Blocking with a shield costs stamina equal to GMST coefficient + Additional coefficient\n<br />GMST coefficient = 5 + % encumbrance * 10 + enemy weapon weight * 2\n<br />Additional coefficient = Shield weight\n<br />* 50% - Block Skill * 20% (or 40% with the Block perk) (Coefficient cannot be lower than 10%)\n<br />\n<br />\xa0\n<br />[b]Arrow block[/b]\n<br />Now has a chance to block arrows, bolts and projectiles,reducing their damage to zero. Such blocking is possible only if the projectile flies to the target at an angle from -90 degrees to 0 degrees (with the shield down) or from -45 to +45 degrees (with active blocking). For NPCs, the angle is always considered as when blocking is active.\n<br />Projectile Block Chance = Skill + Agility/5 + Luck/10\n<br />*% stamina\n<br />* 1.5 - if the Block perk is taken\n<br />* 0.3 - only if there is no active ban (this penalty only affects the player)\n<br />\x2013 Attacker Accuracy / 2\n<br />\x2013 Attacker Agility / 5\n<br />That is, at full stamina at 100 total, while holding anactive block, you have a 195% chance to block the projectile. If the shooter is\n<br />with 50 stats, then this chance will decrease by 35%.\n<br />Successfully blocking a projectile triggers the Block skill increase. The shield loses durability in the amount of 50% of the damage.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />For this mod, consider that all the mentioned perks are taken"
