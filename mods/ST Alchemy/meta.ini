nexusDescription="ST Alchemy is one of the best ingredient mods available for Morrowind. The only problem, is that it's barely available anymore. Stuporstar is no longer actively modding, and while [url=https://stuporstar.sarahdimento.com/other-mods/st-alchemy/]her website[/url]\xa0still hosts version 1.4, the most recent update (version 1.5) was only available from a link on the Morrowind Modding Community Discord server.\n<br />\n<br />Stuporstar had open permissions for most of her mods (as long as she was credited), and after checking with MMC, I decided to upload a copy to Nexus to make it available for the broader community.\n<br />\n<br />To make life a bit easier for everyone, I decided to streamline the installation process a bit. ST Alchemy is now packaged as a BAIN installer, and I've provided information about what each component does so you know whether or not to include it in your game.\n<br />\n<br />Finally, I expanded ST Alchemy's Replacer functionality with a new Dynamic Object Replacer config file, for users with MWSE.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />==========\n<br />Components\xa0\n<br />==========\n<br />\n<br />01 Base\n<br />This contains all the Icons, Meshes, Sounds, and Textures, along with the 'Base' esp that adds ingredients to various leveled lists, along with a single quasi-quest to find the Robe of Ascension.\n<br />\n<br />02 STA Static Replacers\n<br />This esp changes various kelp, moss, and spider web statics around Vvardenfell into containers for kelp, moss, and spider silk ingredients. Note: Stuporstar warned that there may be incompatibilities with large-scale landscape or cave overhauls, but I play with plenty of large-scale overhauls (BCOM among others) and have not encountered any conflicts.\n<br />\n<br />03 Optional Bump Map Meshes\n<br />This folder replaces the smoothed ingredient meshes with new bump-mapped ones. These are purely for personal preference\n<br />\n<br />04 STA Ingredient Rebalance\n<br />This esp overhauls most ingredient effects from the base game, added more negative effects and weakening specific ingredients (particularly those with 'Fortify Intelligence' effects).\xa0\n<br />\n<br />05 STA Economy Rebalance (Alpha)\n<br />This esp affects only Arille (the trader in Seyda Neen) and how he supplies ingredients and potions. While it's fully tested &amp; functional, this component was intended to cover all of Vvardenfell, but never expanded past proof-of-concept.\n<br />\n<br />06 STA Modder's Resource\n<br />This esp contains all the new assets without changes to original MW content.\n<br />\n<br />07 WyreMash Replacer (for OpenMW)\n<br />This folder contains a .txt file intended for use with WyreMash and tes3cmd, to allow you to manually replace mod-added kelp/moss/spider-web statics with STA containers. A how-to guide is included.\n<br />\n<br />08 MWSE Dynamic Object Replacer (25%)\n<br />08 MWSE Dynamic Object Replacer (50%)\n<br />08 MWSE Dynamic Object Replacer (75%)\n<br />These folders contain .lua config files for use with MWSE Dynamic Object Replacer, that will dynamically replace kelp/moss/spider-web statics with STA containers as you play the game. You *must* have DOR installed to use this. The config files are identical besides the 'replaceChance' entry, which determine how often the statics get replaced with an container. You should only use one of these.\n<br />\n<br />I have removed the Graphic Herbalism Addons that were packaged with ST Alchemy 1.5. Instead, you should use the built-in patch that is available on the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46599]MWSE Graphic Herbalism[/url] page.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />============\n<br />Credits &amp; Permissions\n<br />============\n<br />This mod belongs to Stuporstar. Please check out [url=https://stuporstar.sarahdimento.com/]her site[/url], which has some of the greatest Morrowind mods available anywhere. If she returns to active modding, I am entirely willing to take down this page and link to her site. My only contribution was reorganizing the mod folders and providing the Dynamic Object Replacer file.\n<br />\n<br />ST Alchemy is itself a modification of [url=https://modlist.altervista.org/mmh/?quick_filter=Srikandi]Srikandi's Alchemy[/url] mod, found on the now-defunct Morrowind Modding History site.\n<br />\n<br />You may modify this mod without my permission; however, please make sure to credit Stuporstar if you publish it."
