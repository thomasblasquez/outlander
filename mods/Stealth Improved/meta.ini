While many of the settings were adjustable,\n<br />they relied entirely on a random number generator that would compare your attributes to other NPCs, and it did so every 5 seconds.\n<br />This caused you to constantly pop in and out of stealth, and take multiple seconds to go into stealth and be noticed. It was a mess.\n<br />\n<br />Thanks to MWSE-lua, I have the ultimate power to replace the formula entirely, and I've done to using the original as a guide.\n<br />\n<br />The original formula can be found [url=https://wiki.openmw.org/index.php?title=Research:NPC_AI_Behaviour#Combat_behaviour]here[/url]\n<br />\n<br />The new formula goes something like this:\n<br />[center][Player][/center][center]\n<br />[list=1]\n<br />[*]base = (Sneak + Agility * 0.2 + luck * 0.1)\n<br />[*]Subtract penalties for wearing medium or heavy armor\n<br />[*]Multiply by +25% for full fatigue or -25% for empty fatigue\n<br />[*]Multiply by between 0.5 and 10 depending on distance to the target (closer is lower)\n<br />[*]Add 50% of chameleon, add invisibility bonus\n<br />[/list][/center]\n<br />[center][NPC]\n<br />[list=1]\n<br />[*]base = 150% of their sneak skill (most NPCs are very blind, and they rarely have any bonuses) + 0.2 agility + 0.1 luck - blinded effect\n<br />[*]If you are within the front/side viewing angle of the NPC, multiply by 3, if not, multiply by 0.5\n<br />[*]Multiply by +25% for full fatigue or -25% for empty fatigue\n<br />[/list][/center]\n<br />[center][Final]\n<br />If player - detector is &gt;= 50 (adjustable), you are sneaking[/center]\n<br />[u][b]Rant on Invisibility[/b][/u]\n<br />It's impossible to address stealth without also addressing invisibility mechanics. Previously, invisibility made you perfect.\n<br />You could not be seen whatsoever. In this mod, invisibility makes you permanently \"behind the enemy\" and provides a flat bonus.\n<br />Why would invisibility help you if the enemy couldn't see you? This makes sneak or chameleon still necessary to hide, and means\n<br />enemies still still attack you if you are very close to them and invisible!\n<br />\n<br />And of course invisibility's close relative chameleon\n<br />Chameleon in the base game just added flat sneak skill. In this, by default, it adds [0.5, adjustable] sneak skill.\n<br />It's still fantastic, just not game-breakingly so. \n<br />\n<br />[u][b]InvisFix[/b][/u]\n<br />Invisibility is completely and utterly broken. A mage of mediocre worth can become a master thief in a single spell. \n<br />Want to steal a limeware platter? Just cast invisibility in front of someone and then grab it, problem solved!\n<br />This mod includes a toggleable feature called Invis Fix that drops stealth before you activate something.\n<br />\n<br />There is a Mod Configuration Menu included:\n<br />-Toggle mod on/off\n<br />-Toggle invisibility fix\n<br />-Adjust basically every variable in this mod\n<br />[b][u]\n<br />New! Light-based Sneaking Beta[/u][/b]\n<br />-Only works indoors\n<br />-Increases stealth by ash/blight/blizzards outdoors\n<br />\n<br />1.2 Update by Necrolesian\n<br />-\"Enable light-based stealth\" off by default.\n<br />-\"Show light bar\" off by default.\n<br />-\"Percentage effectiveness of chameleon\" set to 25 (from 50).\n<br />-Chameleon magnitude capped at 100.\n<br />-Chameleon and invisibility bonuses don't stack; instead, you will get the highest bonus from either of the two.\n<br />-MCM \"NPC sneak bonus\" slider fixed.\n<br />\n<br />[u][b]Requirements[/b][/u]\n<br />-MGEXE\n<br />-MWSE-lua beta branch (available here: https://nullcascade.com/mwse/mwse-dev.zip )\n<br />-OpenMW is not supported\n<br />\n<br />[u][b]Installation[/b][/u]\n<br />-Drag and drop data files folder, merge if asked.\n<br />[b]\n<br />[u]Uninstallation[/u][/b]\n<br />-Remove or rename the main.lua file. There is also a mod configuration option to disable the mod as well.\n<br />\n<br />[center]Special Thanks:\n<br />Necrolesian - Bugfixing\n<br />Sigourn - Maintainer\n<br />Remiros - Invisibility Fix\n<br />Nullcascade - MWSE\n<br />Hrnchamd - MWSE[/center]"
