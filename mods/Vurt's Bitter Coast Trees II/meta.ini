nexusDescription="2025-04-10: an animated version has been released:\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/56332]Vurt's Animated BC Trees at Morrowind Nexus - Mods and community[/url]\n<br />\n<br />Vurt's Bitter Coast Trees II v1.2\n<br />\n<br />New trees for the Bitter Coast region.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />* 5 additional unique trees are added to various places in the BC region. It's not too many, shouldn't conflict with other mods, but let me know if it does.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />* flora_bc_shelffungus 1-4 are made bigger to stick out of the trees properly.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />* a few trees are moved from their original location to better fit the enviroment, like the tree standing almost directly infront of  the lighthouse in Seyda Neen.\n<br />\n<br />The .esp has been cleaned from GMST's using Morrowind Enchanted Editor.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3]Changes in v1.2*:\n<br />\n<br />[/size][/b]Mesh edits by [b]Rytelier[/b] (from his [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46418?tab=posts]remaster[/url] mod).  \n<br />All new textures!\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3]Graphic Herbalism compatibility\xa0[/size][/b]\n<br />[i]\"[/i][i]Overwriting the meshes in question with the graphic herbalism meshes fixed it for me. Using MWSE. So at the moment the order is to install yours first and then GH, overwriting meshes when prompted.\"[/i]\n<br />From user\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/users/6041422]micheru12[/url]"
