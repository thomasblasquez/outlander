nexusDescription="[size=4][center][b]Part of the May Modathlon Month[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Does a few things related to...ivy![/center][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]00 Core: replaces every instance of ivy in the game with the models made by Vegetto[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]01 BCoM addon: also swaps the ivy added by BCoM to some interiors (like the trader in Caldera).[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]02 Trellis addon: adds a trellis full of ivy on one of the hlaalu balconies in Suran and in the Dren Plantation.\xa0[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]02 Trellis addon for BCoM:\xa0 same as the previous one, but as BCoM has more than just one suitable spot for this type of addon in Suran, so there's an optional version for it that adds a trellis both outside the manor and on the bookseller's balcony.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]02 Trellis addon - vanilla ivy: as I think the trellis addon is too neat to be tied to an ivy replacer, there's also an optional version for those who want to keep using the vanilla ivy. Completely un-related to what the rest of the mod does. [b]Could have been a separate mod and is actually a standalone esp[/b], but I didn't want to make another modpage just for this.\n<br />\n<br />02 Trellis addon - vanilla ivy for BCoM: self explanatory[/size]\n<br />[size=3]\n<br />Note: for those worried the trellis is not vanilla friendly: the model is an unused vanilla model that we simply edited a bit.\n<br />\n<br />[/size][center][size=3]Why the addons add trellises only in Suran and at the Dren plantation?\n<br />The ivy itself is already used, for the most part, in the Ascadian Isles. The unfinished trellis model with the vine growing around it uses a textures from the Ascadian isles trees.\n<br />But apart from the plans Bethesda might have had for these, I think terraces with trellises and ivy fit particularly well with the hlaalu architecture and with the Ascadian Isles climate/colour scheme.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]That's all.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]Cheers![/size][/center]"
