nexusDescription="[center]\xfeff[size=6][u]Caius Gives You a Cover Story\n<br />[/u][/size][size=1]A small immersion/roleplaying mod by RingComics\n<br />\n<br />[/size][/center]\xa0 Ever\xa0\x66\x65\x65l like you don't have any direction on what to do with your character before you're ready to tackle the main quest? With this mod, Caius will recommend you factions to join based on your skills the first time you ask about orders. Faction recommendations are based on how many of your character's Major skills are also a faction's preferred skills.\n<br />\n<br />[center][size=5]\xfeffInstallation\n<br />[/size][/center]Extract to Data Files, or install using a mod manager. Uninstall by deleting the [font=Lucida Sans Unicode][b]MWSE&#92;mods&#92;ring&#92;CGYCS[/b][/font] folder or removing from your mod manager.\n<br />\n<br />[center][size=5]Compatibility\n<br />[/size][/center]Compatible with everything (or should be). To add a new faction or to make a usually unjoinable faction part of the recommendations, use the interop. Example:\n<br />[code]\xfefflocal CoverStoryInterop = require(\"ring.cgycs.interop\")\n<br />\n<br />-- Make a faction joinable\n<br />CoverStoryInterop.joinable[FactionName] = true\n<br />\n<br />-- Make a faction approachable (Caius will recommend these factions first, and are generally seen as easy to join in lore)\n<br />CoverStoryInterop.approachable[FactionName] = true\n<br />-- Set it to false if the faction is not easy to join or shouldn't be joined by a level 1 character.\n<br />\n<br />-- Make a faction racist. Caius won't recommend racist factions to non-Dunmer\n<br />CoverStoryInterop.racist[FactionName] = true[/code]\n<br />[center][size=5]Configuration\n<br />[/size][/center]Coming soon![size=1]tm[/size]"
