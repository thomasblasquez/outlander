nexusDescription="This is a high resolution replacement for the Daedric font used in scrolls, based on Dongle's Oblivion fonts found here: [url=https://www.imperial-library.info/content/daedric-alphabet]www.imperial-library.info/content/daedric-alphabet\n<br />[/url]\n<br />Two styles are available: Standard and Aligned. The Standard style has haphazard letter sizes and positions and is (almost) identical to Morrowind's original Daedric font. The Aligned style has uniformly positioned letters of similar sizes, which is how Dongle's font is arranged.\n<br />\n<br />As with Morrowind's original, uppercase and lowercase letters are identical and there are no numbers or punctuation marks. The letters X and Y are not present in the original either, but variants for both styles are available which do contain them. Non-English languages are technically supported, but any non-Latin characters in the text will be displayed as blank spaces."
