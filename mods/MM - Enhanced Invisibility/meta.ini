Instead of only becoming transparent, you see through an ethereal lens that warps and twists the environment around you. Daedra and Undead appear differently, making them distinct from other creatures around you. Watch the video to see exactly how the new visual effects should work.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[size=3]This mod is inspired by the visual effects of Frodo's ring in The Lord of the Rings movies.\xa0\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[size=3]This mod does not use an ESP. This mod IS NOT compatible with OpenMW, at least until support for MWSE mods is added.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][b]Magic Mechanics Mod Series[/b][/size]\n<br />[size=3]The Magic Mechanics mod series is a collection of mods that expand, improve and alter the vanilla Morrowind magic system in various ways.
