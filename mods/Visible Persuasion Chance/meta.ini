nexusDescription="[size=4][size=3]Ever wanted to make a logical decision on how to persuade someone ? Want to see if you can intimidate someone ? Are you on an important quest and can't afford to make mistakes ? Or you just do not want to get on the bad side of your boss. Now with this mod get to know your chances and take the risk accordingly. \n<br />Don't just spam those buttons and see that you failed miserably. Isn't it sad that even if your intelligence is high you make dumb mistakes, not knowing when to intimidate or admire or bribe. Don't worry, I've got you covered.\n<br />\n<br />If you want to know more, see the images.\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][u][b]Added in new version[/b][/u][/size]\n<br />\n<br />Now the chances can be displayed as \"Low\", \"High\" etc instead of percentages. \n<br />By default percentage is displayed. Change in MCM.\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][u][b]Requirements[/b][/u][/size]\n<br />\n<br />This mod uses MWSE Lua, so you must have MWSE 2.1 or later. Alternatively, run MWSE-Update.exe preset in the Morrowind root folder if you have MGE-XE.\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][u][b]Installation[/b][/u][/size]\n<br />\n<br />Download and extract the files to Morrowind/Data Files. Or install using your mod manager. Safe to uninstall anytime.\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][u][b]Compatibility[/b][/u][/size]\n<br />\n<br />Compatible with any UI retexture mods. Give a Gift is also compatible, but the percentage success for that option won't be displayed. If you run into any problems, post in the comments section.\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][u][b]Credits[/b][/u][/size]\n<br />\n<br />Bethesda for the awesome game.[/size][/size]\n<br />[size=4][size=3][size=4][size=3]MWSE-Lua team for the Lua scripting addon.\n<br />OpenMW research team for their invaluable research on this [url=https://wiki.openmw.org/index.php?title=Research:Disposition_and_Persuasion]topic[/url].[/size][/size][/size][/size]"
