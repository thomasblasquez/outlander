Description:[/u][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Applies visual effects to both NPCs and the player when damaged by fire, frost, shock, poison, or sun spell effects. These effects may be removed through the use of any spell, potion, or service that applies restore or absorb health spell effects. In addition, an optional 'Disfigured' effect that drains personality may be applied while a visual effect is active.\n<br />\n<br />Included is a simple Mod Configuration Menu allowing you to activate and deactivate features to suit your own style of play.\n<br />\n<br />[u][b]III. Compatibility:[/b][/u]\n<br />\n<br />This mod IS NOT compatible with OpenMW, at least until support for lua-based mods is added. Otherwise it should be compatible with any other mod.\n<br />\n<br />[b][u]IV. Installation and Removal:[/u][/b]\n<br />\n<br />To install, simply drop the MWSE folder into your Data Files folder, that's it.\n<br />\n<br />To remove, simply delete the associated mod folder or the 'main.lua' files within.\n<br />\n<br />[b][u]V. Permissions\n<br />\n<br />[/u][/b]This mod's code may be used for any purpose so long as myself and Greatness7 are credited. Likewise, the creators of the included textures must be credited for their use.\n<br />\n<br />[b][u]VI.
