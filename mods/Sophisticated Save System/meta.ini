nexusDescription="[center][font=Times New Roman][size=6][b]\xfeffSophisticated Save System[/b][/size][/font]\n<br />[font=Arial][i]MWSE-Lua mod by NullCascade[/i]\n<br />\n<br />[u]Part of the May Modathon Month[/u][/font][/center]\n<br />This mod changes how saves are handled by Morrowind. The goal of the mod is to provide more types of autosaves, as well as a rotating list of quicksaves/autosaves so that the player always has a save to go back to.\n<br />\n<br />The plugin is documented to help new MWSE-Lua modders learn how to make this style of mod. It is MIT licensed. Please use it to learn and make cool things!\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3]Requirements &amp; Installation[/size][/b]:\n<br />This mod uses the [i]alpha and thus experimental and not necessarily stable[/i]\xa0\x32.1-branch of MWSE, currently in development. By using this mod, you're basically asking to be a tester! If you encounter any issues [i]please post a report, ideally on the [url=https://github.com/MWSE/MWSE/issues]MWSE bug tracker[/url]. [/i]You can download the latest nightly build from the link below.\n<br />\n<br />This mod requires\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/26348]Morrowind Graphic Extender (MGE-XE) version 0.10.0[/url]. Older versions will not work with MWSE 2.0+! Additionally, it will require the [url=http://nullcascade.com/mwse/mwse-dev.zip]latest nightly build of MWSE 2.1[/url].\n<br />\n<br />To install the mod, extract the archive into your Morrowind installation folder. There is no ESP to activate.\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3]Features[/size][/b]:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Overrides autosaves and quicksaves to keep a rotating queue of saves. By default there are 10 save slots. This can be changed in the mod's config menu.\n<br />[*]Changes the quickload behavior to load the newest save (be it manual, auto, or quicksave) instead of the quicksave. This can be turned off in the config, in which case the latest quicksave is loaded instead.\n<br />[*]Allows a hard save to be performed, creating a brand new save in a slot that the doesn't count against the rotating slot system. This save will have a name that includes the timestamp of the save. To create a hard save, hold Alt and press the QuickSave key.\n<br />[*]Autosaves are expanded to happen on other events. These events can be turned off individually in the config menu. To prevent saves from happening too close to one another, a minimum time between saves option (default of 1 minute) can be set. The current events are:[list]\n<br />[*]Every X minutes (configurable, 10 by default).\n<br />[*]On combat start.\n<br />[*]On combat end.\n<br />[*]On cell change.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[*]The mod contains a configuration menu to configure autosave timings, and other features. To access it, hold Alt and Shift while pressing the QuickSave key.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/Jr89swa.png[/img]\xfeff\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/8mmhOmW.png[/img]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/Clpdeza.png[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/gqCUpMI.png[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/tUQe3GJ.png[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/kJ67VWQ.png[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/Pv7VWUb.png[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/LoZshAZ.png[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/JXPxd4A.png[/img]\xfeff[img]https://i.imgur.com/U34tnIX.png[/img]\xfeff[img]https://i.imgur.com/6RlXvbJ.png[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/4iRzG2W.png[/img][/center]"
