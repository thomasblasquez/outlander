nexusDescription="Invisible Spell Effect Library keeps a record of all the unique spell effects you've learned that can be used for spellmaking and enchanting.\xa0 Even if you delete all spells that use those effects from your spell list, when the spellmaking and enchanting UIs are opened, it checks the effects against the ones you know and inserts any missing ones into the list.\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]Installation[/size]\n<br />-------------\n<br />Requires Morrowind Script Extender (MWSE).\xa0 Install MWSE first.\xa0 If you have Morrowind Graphics Extender XE(MGE XE) installed, MWSE is already installed.\n<br />Extract the invisible_spell_effect_library folder into the MWSE mods folder. &lt;Morrowind install directory&gt;&#92;Data Files&#92;MWSE&#92;mods\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]Removal[/size]\n<br />-------------\n<br />Delete the invisible_spell_effect_library folder.\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]Instructions[/size]\n<br />-------------\n<br />Automatically syncs new effects in your spell list with the effect repository when you load your save or purchase any spell from an NPC vendor.\xa0 It will only sync spell effects that can be used for enchanting or spellmaking.\xa0 It will not sync spells and powers granted from race or birth sign.\xa0 Will work with custom effects from mods, if they are valid for spellmaking/enchanting.\n<br />\n<br />Cannot currently detect if you gain spells as quest rewards, or via things like the spell grimoires some mods add.\xa0 If you gain a qualifying spell by non-vendor means it will not trigger an automatic sync, but as long as you hang onto the spell in your spell list, it will be added to your repository at the next automatic sync.\xa0 You can also manually trigger a sync from the mod's config menu, available in the \"Mod Config\" entry in the Esc menu.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff0000][size=4]Warning:[/size][/color]\n<br />The mod is unable to populate effects into the spellmaking and enchanting UIs if they start completely empty. So you must keep at least 1 valid spell in your spell list.\xa0 So just, you know, don't delete literally everything and you're good.\n<br />\n<br />To aid in tracking spell effects you know and have yet to learn, once you know any spells, it will create a book in your inventory named \"Your Spellbook\" which when read will display all the effects you know, sorted by school, with custom effects from mods at the end.\xa0 It will be automatically replaced if missing during syncs so you can't lose it.\xa0 If you don't want one, this behavior can be turned off from within the config menu (This setting is currently global only).\xa0 You can also manually generate a book from within the config menu if you want one. \xa0\n<br />\n<br />The spell vendor menu will show * next to spells which have effects you haven't yet learned.\xa0 This behavior can also be disabled from the config menu (Global only).\n<br />\n<br />Acknowledgements\n<br />----------------\n<br />The MWSE dev team and Morrowind modding discord\n<br />Specific thanks to Greatness7, Hrnchamd, Sephumbra and Ohayo"
