nexusDescription="[size=4][u][b]OVERVIEW[/b][/u][/size]\n<br />\n<br />Minigame mods are my favourite niche of Morrowind. Another thing I really like to do in games is gamble. So I put both ideas together and created this compilation of gambling games, to be enjoyed in various casinos!\n<br />\n<br />The locations are scarce, and low-key, since from what I understand gambling is banned, or at least frowned upon.\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][u][b]FEATURES[/b][/u][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][b]Games[/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Daedra's Turn\n<br />[/list]   \xfeff   \xfeff\x42\x61sically just Roulette. Place bets, spin the wheel, hope it lands on a winning number! Affected by luck.\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Greed\n<br />[/list]   \xfeff   \xfeffYou roll one die as much as you want, tallying the score, but if you roll a 1 or your opponent gets a higher score, you lose. Affected by luck.\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Hortator\n<br />[/list]   \xfeff   \xfeffSame game as the one in Tamriel Rebuilt, basically a simplified version of solitaire. I added the ability to bet on winning the game.\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Iron Crown\n<br />[/list]   \xfeff   \xfeffIt's Blackjack, but the deck is different (9 suites of 4-5-6-7-J-Q-K), so the goal is to reach 27 instead of 21.\n<br />   \xfeff   \xfeffThe whole suite of Irons work like aces (ex: a 4 of Irons is worth either 4 or 14)\n<br />   \xfeff   \xfeffStarting with a Blackjack requires a 7 of Irons and a Dragon face card, and the player instantly wins 3:1 their bet.\n<br />   \xfeff   \xfeffThere is a small easter egg that can sometimes appear :)\n<br />   \xfeff   \xfeff\x41\x66\x66\x65\x63ted by luck as of v1.3\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Thirty-Six\n<br />[/list]   \xfeff   \xfeffSame game as the one in Tamriel Rebuilt, but in real-time instead of through dialogue. Roll the dice, trying to reach 36.\n<br />   \xfeff   \xfeffIf you roll over 36 or your opponent gets a higher score than you at 36 or below, you lose. Affected by luck as of v1.3\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3]Casinos[/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Balmora, Council Club: Basement: Can play Daedra's Turn, Hortator and Thirty-Six\n<br />[*]Suran, Desele's House of Earthly Delights: Gambling Hall: Can play Daedra's Turn, Greed, Iron Crown and Nine-holes\n<br />[*]Vivec, No Name Club: Can play Greed, Hortator and Thirty-Six\n<br />[/list][b]Tamriel Rebuilt Addon[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Bal Foyen, Council Club: Can play Greed, Iron Crown and Thirty-Six\n<br />[*]Narsis, The Fortuna: Can play Daedra's Turn, Greed, Hortator, Iron Crown Nine-holes and Thirty-Six\n<br />[/list][b]Project Cyrodiil Addon[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Anvil, The Abecette: Can play Greed, Iron Crown and Nine-holes\n<br />[*]Anvil, The Abecette: Inner Hall: Can play Daedra's Turn, Greed and Iron Crown\n<br />[/list][b]Achievements Addon[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Five achievements, one for winning each game 10 times\n<br />[/list][b][size=3]Casino Bans[/size][/b]\n<br />(New in v1.4!)\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Casinos have a winning limit of 10000 gold.
