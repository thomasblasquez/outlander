nexusDescription="This short adventure is designed to give your character a natural story-based reason to leave [b]Vvardenfel [/b]and travel to one of the cities of [b]Tamriel Rebuilt[/b].\n<br />\n<br />To start, go to [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Addamasartus]Addamasartus[/url]\xfeff (even if it's already cleared). It is a dungeon near [b]Seyda Neen[/b]. You can start the quest at any point of your playthrough.\n<br />\n<br />This mod also introduces a non-vanilla form of Khajiit, the [b]Suthay[/b]. They have human-like feet and are generally smaller than the vanilla [b]Suthay-raht[/b]. You can play as one of these using the Tamriel Unlimited plugin from here:\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45674]M'Aiq on the Mainland and other mods[/url]\xfeff.\n<br />\n<br />Gameplay tips ([i]spoiler alert[/i]):\n<br />[spoiler]- the Khajiit is in the slaves' cell.\n<br />- You need at least 100 drakes to finish the quest.\n<br />- Use a shipmaster in Vivec to go to [b]Old Ebonheart[/b].\n<br />- Go to either [b]Hostel of Stendarr's Mercy[/b] (middle of the Merchants' Street) or the [b]Elsweyr Mission[/b] (the furthest corner of the Ebon Tower courtyard) to finish the quest. Dra'Vashai will give you a city guide.\n<br />- At any point, before reaching Old Ebonheart you can ask Dra'Vashai to return to Arrille's Tradehouse.\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />Technical tips:\n<br />[spoiler]-\xa0The quest mod is split between three sub-quests. If anything breaks, try the following console commands to progress your story:\n<br />journal\xa0Vashai418_Shoes 30\n<br />- you have successfully reached Arrille's.\n<br />journal\xa0Vashai418_Money 30\n<br />- Dra'Vashai repays his debt to you in Seyda Neen.\n<br />journal\xa0Vashai418_Salvation 40\n<br />- End of the questline in Old Ebonheart.\n<br />- If upon finishing the questline he keeps following you (due to mod conflicts, etc), you can simply disable him and pretend that he's ok in Old Ebonheart.\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />Conflicts:\n<br />- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/52420?tab=files&amp;file_id=1000036919]Vennin's Addamasartus Overhaul[/url] creates a new version of the dungeon in the same cell alongside the vanilla one. I don't really have the skill right now to create a workaround for this, I'm sorry.\n<br />\n<br />Any bugreports are welcome!\n<br />\n<br />[b]Consider my other mods[/b]:\n<br />[list=1]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/53181?tab=description]Helaren Tomb Replacer[/url] - an improvement to the bland tomb of the 2nd sergeant mission of the vanilla Imperial Cult.\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/52001]Tamriel Rebuilt Andothren House for Sale[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/53674?tab=posts]Tamriel Rebuilt - Player Home in Hlan Oek[/url]\n<br />[*]Skyrim Home of the Nords -\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49566]Karthwasten House for Sale\n<br />[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/53533/]Addamasartus418[/url] - my humble attempt to overhaul the dungeon. Use an alternative esp of Dra'Vashai with it.\n<br />[/list]\n<br /> [b]Thank you\n<br />[/b]To the members of Tamriel Rebuilt and Project Tamriel for teaching me, testing the mod, proofreading chunks of the text, and giving me precious pieces of advice. And for creating their beautiful mods of course!"
