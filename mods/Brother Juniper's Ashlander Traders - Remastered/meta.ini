I did my best to keep this new dialogue in line with the personalities Brother Juniper created.\n<br />[*]The traders now have leveled items in their inventories, meaning it's worth checking in with them occasionally to see if they've got anything good.\n<br />[*]7 new Ashlander traders (legit members of the tribes, not outcasts like the caravaners). These new traders travel much lighter than the original caravans, but they all have a bit of dialogue and potentially some interesting goods.\n<br />[*]Urshilaku traders will sometimes appear in Khuul and Maar Gan, Andus Tradehouse\n<br />[*]Zainab traders will sometimes appear in the other three camps, and, after completing Trade Goods Wanted, in Vos\xa0\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Brother Juniper's [url=http://mw.modhistory.com/download-65-15507]original Ashlander Traders is available at MMH[/url]\xfeff.\n<br />\n<br />Brother Juniper, if you're reading this - thank you very much for your excellent mods. I hope you don't mind me releasing this edit.\xa0\n<br />[size=5][center]\n<br />[b]Original Readme:[/b][/center][/size]Ashlander Traders\n<br />The Elderscrolls III: Morrowind Plug-In\n<br />---------------------------------------\n<br />Brother Juniper\n<br />humblejuniper@hotmail.com\n<br />\n<br />*****************************************************************\n<br />Synopsis: A travelling Ashlander Caravan will set up shop in the\xa0\n<br />market squares of Balmora, Suran, or Ald-ruhn. A caravan that\xa0\n<br />travels with you offers a unique travel service.\n<br />\n<br />*****************************************************************\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \xa0\x31. INSTALLING THE PLUGIN\n<br />*****************************************************************\n<br />To install the plugin, unzip the files into the Morrowind/Data Files\n<br />directory.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />*****************************************************************\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \xa0\x32. PLAYING THE PLUGIN\n<br />*****************************************************************\n<br />From the Morrowind Launcher, select Data Files and check the box\xa0\n<br />next to the Ashlander Traders.esp file.\n<br />After a certain point in the game, one of these traders will allow\n<br />you access to fast travel between several Ashlander camps, and\xa0\n<br />travel with you.\n<br />HOW IT WORKS (Hints for troubleshooting): Once you have access to\n<br />the service, you must ask Raen to \"travel together.\" If you do so,\n<br />both the guar and Raen follow you. If you tell them to wait around,\n<br />the guar will go back to following Raen.\xa0\n<br />Raen will not allow you to travel if the guar is too far away to\xa0\n<br />follow you on the trip (let me know if you think the distance should\xa0\n<br />be greater or less). If the guar gets too far away from Raen, he\n<br />will stop following you and go looking for the guar - they'll be\n<br />waiting in Ald-ruhn when you get back.\n<br />If you tell Raen to continue on his way, you can find him again just\n<br />outside the gates to Ald-ruhn.\n<br />If you have Tribunal, the \"Companion share\" option should be\xa0\n<br />available once you have access to the travel service.\n<br />\n<br />*****************************************************************\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \xa0\x33. COMMENTS\n<br />*****************************************************************\n<br />I did the original version for myself a while back, and decided to\xa0\n<br />release it. It was inspired by the excellent \"Trade Route\" plugin\xa0\n<br />and the gypsies in Ultima 6. I updated it a little bit, because I\xa0\n<br />always wanted there to be merchants of like you'll find in Balmora's\xa0\n<br />square...it always seemed so empty.\n<br />I worked hard to ensure that there was as little framerate hit as\xa0\n<br />possible in each of these areas, and at least on my computer it's\xa0\n<br />not noticable.\n<br />\n<br />*****************************************************************\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 \xa0\x34. LIST OF CHANGES\n<br />*****************************************************************\n<br />Trading posts were added in Suran, Balmora and Ald-ruhn. The path\n<br />grids were altered in each of these locations so NPCs would adjust\n<br />their steps accordingly."
