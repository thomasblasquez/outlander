nexusDescription="[center][size=4][b]Magic Mechanics - Enhanced Reflection\n<br />By: OperatorJack[/b][/size][/center]\n<br />[center][youtube]97y35ciPElw[/youtube][/center]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4]Requirements[/size][/b]\n<br />This mod requires the most recently nightly build of MWSE. Please be sure to run the mwse-update.exe before playing this mod.\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4]Description[/size][/b]\n<br />This mod adds reflection mechanics to the Reflect, Shield, Fire Shield, Shock Shield, and Frost Shield magic effects for both the Player and NPCs. The behavior of these new mechanics can be controlled through the MCM.\n<br />\n<br />[i]Reflect[/i]: The Reflect magic effect will reflect spell projectiles directly back to their caster.\n<br />\n<br />[i]Shield[/i]: The Shield magic effect will reflect spell projectiles at a realistic angle, depending on where the projectile hits the shielded actor.\n<br />\n<br />[i]Fire Shield[/i]: The Fire Shield magic effect will reflect spell projectiles which contain the fire damage magic effect, at a realistic angle.\n<br />\n<br />[i]Shock Shield[/i]: The Shock Shield magic effect will reflect spell projectiles which contain the shock damage magic effect, at a realistic angle.\n<br />\n<br />[i]Frost Shield[/i]: The Frost Shield magic effect will reflect spell projectiles which contain the frost damage magic effect, at a realistic angle.\n<br />\n<br />Reflection chance is based on the magnitude of the magic effect that is causing the reflection (reflect, shield, etc.). For example, if you have 50 pts of Reflect, you have a 50% chance of reflecting the projectile. Depending on the distance and angle of the projectile to the target, sometimes reflection will still fail (EG, casting from a few inches away). If the reflection fails, the vanilla mechanic will still occur.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Known Issues:[/b]\n<br />- If the projectile is reflected back to the caster, it will move through the caster. This is due to game engine limitations and cannot currently be resolved.\n<br />- The vanilla mechanic still applies, so you essentially get 2 mechanics per magic effect. However, I think this is counterbalanced by considering this mechanic as something happens by chance, not as a given.\n<br />\n<br />[i]This mod does not use an ESP. This mod IS NOT compatible with OpenMW, at least until support for MWSE mods is added.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4]Magic Mechanics Mod Series[/size][/b]\n<br />The Magic Mechanics mod series is a collection of mods that expand, improve and alter the vanilla Morrowind magic system in various ways. Mods in this series start with the abbreviation \"MM\" in their titles.
