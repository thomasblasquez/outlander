nexusDescription="[size=3]A Morrowind Modding Madness 2019 mod by team Dandy Daedra:\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/MQUeRqq.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[/size][center][size=3]\n<br />[/size][/center][center][size=3][img]https://i.imgur.com/Sq3HKmK.png[/img]\n<br />[/size][/center][size=3]\n<br />\n<br />- Adds a new sewer system to explore underneath Ebonheart.\n<br />- A cast of colourful new NPCs to meet.\xa0\n<br />- A number of new misc quests suitable for low-level characters.\xa0\n<br />- Quests with multiple paths, outcomes, and moral choices to make.\n<br />- Dynamic environments with traps and secret passages - be careful where you walk, and always be on the lookout!\n<br />\n<br />[b]Compatibility:\n<br />[/b]Should be compatible with most mods, as most of our changes are in new interiors.\n<br />It should be now compatible with Morrowind Rebirth (at least until Rebirth moves Ebonheart walls again).\n<br />This is done enabling/disabling things by script according to global short variable dd19rebirth.\n<br />If you have MWSE-Lua the mod should auto-detect Rebirth and set the variable, else you will be asked\n<br />once at start if you have Rebirth installed, Yes button will set dd19rebirth to 1 = enabled.\n<br />Or you can change the settings to 0/1 directly from the in game console, e.g.\n<br />set dd19rebirth to 1 (to enable rebirth compatibility)\n<br />set dd19rebirthConfig to 0 (to have the config script reset and run again on save and reload)\n<br />Note that this does not mean we recommend installing rebirth, as it is currently still full of dirty cells and duplicated objects.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/uFGVkoL.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />Drop the contents of the zip into your Data Files folder, or (recommended) use your favourite mod manager.\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/PlQnxV6.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />There is only one Known Bug. He's totally harmless.\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/zFaJeiF.png[/img]\n<br />[size=3]\n<br />1.18 fixed a possible quest entry not disappearing from the journal\n<br />1.17 renamed some statics (from dr_ prefix to dd19 prefix) to prevent possible conflicts with other mods using the same identifiers for containers.\n<br />If you don't have any warnings/crashes about items type conflicts you can skip this update.\n<br />1.16 fixed a row boat position incompatibility with Rebirth moving Ebonheart docks (again...)\n<br />1.15 fixed mwscript.scriptRunning parameter, now mwse-Lua script should always autodetect Rebirth correctly\n<br />1.14 lowered by 1 the number of days passing before some quest-involved NPCs disappear\n<br />1.13 fixed a branch of the prisoner quest not marked as finished (hint: be curious, check the place where you found him after he's gone)\n<br />1.12\xa0\x63ouple more tweaks\n<br />1.11\n<br />- small dialog tweak\n<br />- fixed starting script question sometimes running 2 times\n<br />1.10b fixed a possible incompatibility in MWSE&#92;mods&#92;dd19&#92;02&#92;main.lua script\n<br />[/size]1.10\n<br />- tweaked 2 spells\n<br />- fixed a rebirth conflict, tweaked a couple grates positions\n<br />- added a dd19noThief global short variable. If you use\n<br />set dd19noThief to 1\n<br />in the game console, you will be able to get the (previously reserved to Thieves Guild members only) 3rd branch of a multi branch quest even if you are not a Thieves Guild member(set dd19noThief to 0 to get the quest branch only for if you are a Thieves Guild member).\n<br />1.09 fixed having a quest possibly giving you a ring more than once\n<br />1.08 fixed a not visible note text, some containers capacity, a typo, a finished quest possibly remaining in journal, a sconce rotation/animation glitch\n<br />1.07 more tweaks\n<br />1.06 more minor item positioning tweaks, the wife of the drunken nord has no more intro line after the husband has sobered up, fixed a \"I need to some rest\" scripted message\n<br />1.05 tweaks, should be compatible with Morrowind Rebirth\n<br />1.04 rowboat ebony script fixes\n<br />1.03 quest fixes\n<br />1.02 Added journal update to 'escape' topic\n<br />1.01 Minor fixes\n<br />1.00 Original release\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/mjuETO6.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43186]Imperial Grates Resource[/url] by Melchior Dahrk\xa0\n<br />[url=https://arcimaestroantares.webs.com/mymods.htm]Dungeon and Diamond[/url] by Archimaestro Antares (for models and scripts)\xa0\n<br />[url=https://www.patreon.com/LondonRook/posts]Outlander Library[/url] by LondonRook (platforms, banner, clutter)\xa0\n<br />Darknut for the moss models\n<br />LadyE and Proudfoot for the[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44076] shroomster[/url] model\xa0\xa0\n<br />\n<br />I\n<br />I\n<br />I\n<br />I\n<br />I\n<br />I\n<br />I\n<br />I\n<br />I\n<br />I\n<br />I\n<br />I\n<br />I\n<br />I\n<br />I\n<br />I\n<br />I\n<br />I\n<br />I\n<br />I\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/7m6Foma.png[/img]\n<br />- Talk to the Drunk Nord or his Nord wife, there are non-violent outcomes- The \"easy job\" quest has 3 involved parties, you can side with either.\n<br />- To access the Twin Lamp hideout, help an Argonian in the Sewers or find the secret door from the Argonian Mission.\n<br />- To get a clue about the owner of the ring, equip it\n<br />- Playing [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47219]Shal Overgrown[/url] first can get you a reward from the Shroom quest\n<br />- To get to the hidden cache, find the missing brick\n<br />- To get past the portcullis, get stronger\n<br />- To get a positive outcome from the statues, increase your luck.[/size]"
