nexusDescription="This is a compilation of my meshes created for the [url=https://forum.openmw.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=2349]Morrowind Original Asset Replacement[/url] project that started at the OpenMW forums some time ago. Unfortunately the project hasn&#39;t survived, but my work for this project did, so I decided to release it to the public. \r<br />Goal of this project was to create mesh replacers that would be just like vanilla meshes, but with overall quality up to today&#39;s standards, more details that were previously displayed only at vanilla textures and also some bugfixes, for messed UVs, missing faces, hidden geometry, doubled vertices, bad collision meshes etc.\r<br />\r<br />This set contains mostly exterior &#34;com&#34; and &#34;de&#34; dock meshes with more rounded logs and ropes, railings and some doors.\r<br />It also contains improved plant containers with picked variants, if you&#39;re not using the Graphical Herbalism mod, feel free to delete the Meshes/GHerb folder.\r<br />\r<br />If you find any bugs or something, let me know."
