nexusDescription="[u]Part of the May Modathon Month\n<br />\n<br />[/u]Have you ever wanted to roleplay a Dunmer nationalist who takes no orders from the mongrel dogs of the Empire? But the Main Quest still bullied you into being a Blades agent? Good news!\n<br />\n<br />Inspired by the traditions of role playing games, now there are two paths to complete the Main Quest. One of them is the regular one, being an Imperial agent. The other one is to take the package in the first quest to a rival (vanilla, and lore friendly) faction, and work for them. To begin, when you exit the Census and Excise Office in Seyda Neen, talk to the Dunmer standing there.\n<br />\n<br />I think that this is an excellent roleplaying opportunity to Dunmer nationalists, especially to Telvanni.\n<br />\n<br />Please note: Due to the fact that native Dunmers, (especially your new employer, who is technically a scholar) obviously know about the Nerevarine prophecies and the Sixth House, unlike an Imperial, the first three quests will be skipped. As far as the rest of the quests are concerned there is one which is totally different, in the rest there are minor alterations.\n<br />\n<br />Bonus features (possibly spoilers - skip this part, if you want some [hopefully] pleasant surprises):\n<br />\n<br />- Your status as \"Nerevarine\" will be listed in your character page upon touching the Moon and Star\n<br />- In the Cavern of the Incarnate, Conoon Chodala will retell you his story from The Elder Scrolls Online\n<br />\n<br />Changes in version 1.1.:\n<br />\n<br />- Bugfixes\n<br />\n<br />Version 1.2.:\n<br />\n<br />- Caius Cosades will be disabled after deciding to side with Aryon, in order to prevent a bug in which Caius acted like the player was still a Blades agent\n<br />- Restored main quest content that were left out from this mod (disturbing dreams, cultist attacks etc.)\n<br />\n<br />Version 1.3.:\n<br />\n<br />- Further bugfixes\n<br />\n<br />Version 1.4.:\n<br />\n<br />- The settlements of Sadrith Mora and Tel Vos will be marked on your map when you start the nationalist path so that you will be able to find them more easily\n<br />- The dialogue that starts the nationalist path will not trigger if you don't have the Package for Caius Cosades in your inventory (to prevent issues for alternative chargen mod users)\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/Jr89swa.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/sFLMBx9.png[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/Pv7VWUb.png[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/24QRb4N.png[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/JrsFVr2.png[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/3nLRF0y.png[/img]\xfeff[img]https://i.imgur.com/gqCUpMI.png[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/LoZshAZ.png[/img][/center]"
