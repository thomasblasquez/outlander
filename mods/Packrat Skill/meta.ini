nexusDescription="This is a simple skill that lets players organize their inventory more efficiently. Keeping an inventory full of things has taught your player how to carry more things. Adds a new skill that can be trained! \n<br />\n<br />How it works: As long as your inventory is more than 70% full and you are moving around, you'll get xp in the packrat skill. Every level in the packrat skill gives the player their packrat level in feather, so at level 1 you have 1 feather, and level 100 you have 100 feather!\n<br />\n<br />This mod was originally going to feature a short series of quests where the player would need to transport/smuggle certain items across the map to tie some gameplay in with the skill, but I couldn't think of a good way to make something like that fun and still don't understand how to use the construction set lol. So if you're a modder that wants to add some related content, feel free!\n<br />\n<br />Why I made it: I honestly just love leveling skills up. This gives my players something passive to train and gives a very simple bonus that can end up being pretty helpful at higher levels without breaking the game. Big thanks to Merlord for his Skills Module, wouldn't have been able to make this without it!\n<br />\n<br />This mod was fixed to not need a plugin file by RingComics at github. Find his Morrowind Overhaul modlist here:\xa0https://github.com/RingComics/yajan\n<br />\n<br />If you like this mod, please check out the game I made! You can find it on steam here:\xa0https://store.steampowered.com/app/1793340/Under_The_Warehouse/\n<br />\n<br />Please let me know if you find any glitches or problems! This is my first mod and I don't know Lua but I tested it and haven't had any issues."
