nexusDescription="[b][center]3rd place winner of the May Modathon Month 2017[/center][/b]\n<br />Even the old Dwemer needed some fun! During your adventures through the abandoned Dwemer ruins you can now find various pieces of the ancient Dwemer boardgame, called The Game of Twenty Squares. The whole set consists of a gameboard, 7+7 figures and four dices. If you're lucky or observant enough, perhaps you can even find the rulebook explaining how to play it. The game is inspired by the ancient Sumerian game \"The Royal Game of Ur\"...and actually, Dagoth Ur likes to play it too. Enjoy!\n<br />\n<br />If you want to experience the actual gameplay, go also check the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/53914]Playable Game of Ur[/url] mod by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/users/24248299]Dillonn241[/url]!"
