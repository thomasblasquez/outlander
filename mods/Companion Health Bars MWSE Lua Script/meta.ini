nexusDescription="This mod is a work in progress. Use at your own risk and be sure to back up your saves beforehand. That said, I feel it's stable enough at the moment to release for other people to try out. Just be aware there could be crashes.\n<br />\n<br />To use this mod you'll need the latest version of MGE XE and its included version of MWSE.\n<br />\n<br />Once you have all the dependencies installed,\xa0 just move the included data files folder into the Morrowind directory and it should be good to go.\n<br />\n<br />Includes an MCM menu for blacklisting specific actors, changing the polling rate for updating the health bars, and toggling on/off the event-based health update.\n<br />\n<br />As of version 0.4a, you can reposition the health bar menu by clicking and dragging it while the command console is open.\n<br />\n<br />If you run into any issues or have any suggestions, leave a comment and I'll try to respond."
