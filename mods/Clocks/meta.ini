nexusDescription="[size=4]Description[/size]\n<br />\n<br />It is not required but please make sure to read the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/articles/346]General Notice[/url] if you want to learn more about this and my other mods.\n<br />\n<br />Having a clock in the HUD is quite handy. I find an in-game time clock very useful when using immersion and overhaul mods, e.g., Ashfall, and a real-time clock is essential to keep track of time in these unfortunate occasions that you can't delve into Morrowind for as long as you want. The [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46292]MWSE Clock Block[/url] by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/users/20765944]Aleist3r[/url] does an excellent job of providing access to both of these clocks, however, the mod hasn't been updated for a while and some functionality, e.g., a key to switch between the clocks hasn't been added yet. Clocks is a rewrite of the MWSE Clock Block that features the following improvements:\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]The ability to switch between clocks using a specified key (defaults to &lt;n&gt;) without visiting the MCM.\n<br />[*]The ability to show both clocks at the same time in the HUD.\n<br />[*]A fixed 12-Hour format representation (12:** pm was not always represented correctly in the original mod.\n<br />[*]The in-game time clock is updated only during simulation time (i.e., outside of menus) at a rate of an in-game minute.\n<br />[*]The real-time clock is updated at a rate of a real-time minute.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />The mod is currently under alpha-testing, so bugs are to be expected. Please let me know of any issues and I'll try to fix them as soon as possible.\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]Credits[/size]\n<br />\n<br />All credits for the idea behind this mod go to [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/users/20765944]Aleist3r[/url]\xfeff and their [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46292]MWSE Clock Block[/url]\xfeff."
