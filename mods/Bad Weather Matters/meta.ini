nexusDescription="[b][center]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n<br />Bad Weather Matters\xa0 v1.0\n<br />by Ian\n<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~[/center][/b]\n<br />\n<br />============\n<br />[b]Requirements[/b]\n<br />============\n<br />This mod requires the latest versions of Morrowind, Tribunal, and Bloodmoon.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />========\n<br />[b]Conflicts[/b]\n<br />========\n<br />This mod will conflict with anything else that applies effects to your character according to the weather. An example is the mod Weather Effects.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />==========\n<br />[b]Description[/b]\n<br />==========\n<br />With this mod, you will suffer ill effects depending on the weather. You will only experience these effects while outside. Different races will experience the weather differently according to their own inherent strengths.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Mod features and details[/b]\n<br />-------------------------------------\n<br />1. The following weather brings ill effects: Rain, thunderstorms, ash storms, blight storms, and blizzards. Below are details.\n<br />2. The strength of these effects will fluctuate every few seconds while they are active. This is to add some immersion. Imagine the rain or wind changing strength over time, and therefore changing the effects you experience.\n<br />3. Works with new and existing characters.\n<br />4. Weather and race details:\n<br />\n<br />Rain\n<br />-------\n<br />A minor drain to your Agility. Argonians are immune.\n<br />\n<br />Thunderstorm\n<br />---------------------\n<br />A more serious drain to your Agility plus a Weakness to Shock. Argonians will suffer a less severe version of this.\n<br />\n<br />Ash Storms\n<br />-----------------\n<br />A drain to your Fatigue. Dunmer will suffer a less severe version.\n<br />\n<br />Blight Storms\n<br />--------------------\n<br />A minor drain to your Strength, a drain to your Fatigue, and a Weakness to Blight Disease. No race is spared from a Blight Storm, but if you have 100% Blight Resistance, you will not suffer a Weakness to Blight Disease.\n<br />\n<br />Blizzard\n<br />------------\n<br />A minor drain to your Speed, and a drain to your Fatigue. Nords will suffer a less severe version of this.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Note: Whenever the weather changes, there will be a delay in the addition or removal of these weather effects. This is because even after the weather seems to have finished changing into something different, the game's weather designation \"lingers\" for a moment after it changes. This just how the game works.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />====================\n<br />[b]Installation Instructions[/b]\n<br />====================\n<br />1. Save and back-up your game. This is a good idea any time you start using a new mod.\n<br />2. Install the content of this archive into your Morrowind/Data Files folder.\n<br />3. Enable \"Bad Weather Matters\" in your mod list.\n<br />4. To update the mod, just replace it with the new file.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />=============\n<br />[b]Version History[/b]\n<br />=============\n<br />v1.0\n<br />----\n<br />Original release.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />=======\n<br />[b]Credits[/b]\n<br />=======\n<br />GhanBuriGhan, Yacoby and Melian for the guide Morrowind Scripting for Dummies.
