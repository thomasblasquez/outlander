nexusDescription="[b]Buying Game Updated\n<br />[/b][i]by vaelta\n<br />[/i]\n<br />---\n<br />\n<br />This is an updated \"[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50574]Buying Game[/url]\" by Vitruvian Guar. Please check out the original mod to see its feature list. It is by far the most interesting overhaul of Morrowind's trading system (though I personally also recommend using it in conjunction with mods that lower the values of all items - no more selling Daedric armour and weapons for vast amounts of money..).\n<br />\n<br />The primary change to the original mod is to fix the broken \"forbidden item\" flag mechanic. It has now been decoupled from the regional pricing mechanic.\n<br />\n<br />I have also altered the skill thresholds, but more importantly, I have spent quite a bit of time adding in local pricing mechanics to make items cheaper or more expensive dependent on location. I have really tried quite hard to apply a bit of real world logic to this, though I have had to make up a few scenarios in order to try and make the mod interesting for pure \"trader\" characters. For instance, I have made Old Ebonheart one of the few places where goods from Cyrodiil and other parts of Tamriel are cheaper - and all other Imperial towns are more expensive. (Hint: buy in Old Ebonheart, sell in the other Imperial towns.)\n<br />\n<br />Edit to add: Tamriel Rebuilt (and I'm assuming other mods) NPCs cannot be added to the custom list of smugglers. I don't know why this is the case and it is probably beyond my ability to try and fix (it is a bug from the original mod). This is one reason why I recommend people use the Silver Tongue mod, as using that you can bribe NPCs down to zero Alarm, at which point you can sell them anything. In my opinion that is quite a realistic way of doing it - spending a bit of coin before offloading your loot!\n<br />\n<br />UPDATE: I have realised that I hadn't fixed this quite as well as I thought. However, it is still better than the original: the forbidden items mechanic is now tied to the \"knowledge of value\" mechanic, which does make a lot more sense. I've now got mine set to 20 mercantile. Apologies it wasn't quite as fixed as I thought.\n<br />\n<br />---\n<br />\n<br />[b]Requirements:\n<br />[/b]\n<br />Tamriel Rebuilt is not a hard requirement, but I have included pretty much all the areas in the config file, so it would be a bit silly to not use in conjunction with TR.\n<br />Skyrim Home of the Nords and Project Cyrodiil Stirk have also been included in the config.\n<br />\n<br />---\n<br />\n<br />[b]Installation:\n<br />[/b]Place in the usual MWSE folder. (Also recommended to delete old config if using previous version - see below.)\n<br />\n<br />---\n<br />\n<br />[b]Compatibility:\n<br />[/b]Should be compatible with everything.\n<br />\n<br />---\n<br />\n<br />[b]Bugs:\n<br />[/b]If you already run Buying Game I recommend deleting your existing config file (in &#92;MWSE&#92;config&#92;buyinggame.json) before using this, otherwise it can get a bit tangled up trying to merge the old and new config settings.\n<br />\n<br />And about NPCs from mods and custom smuggler lists, see above.\n<br />\n<br />---\n<br />\n<br />[b]Recommended mods:\n<br />[/b][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45529]Mods that reduce item values.\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48070]Gold weight mod[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/53736]Stormrider[/url] (my TR version - you can now be a merchant on the seas)\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49086]Silvertongue\n<br />[/url]My [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/54889]Imperial Bank[/url] - makes a great companion mod to this.\n<br />\n<br />---\n<br />\n<br />[b]Credits:\n<br />[/b]Vitruvian Guar for the Buying Game mod.\n<br />Null Cascade for some more fixes."
