Please be sure to run the mwse-update.exe before playing this mod. If your MWSE build is not from March 1, 2020 or newer, you will receive errors.\n<br />\n<br />This mod requires the\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47111]Magicka Expanded[/url]\xa0\x62\x61se package, version 3.0.0 or newer.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b]Description[/b]\n<br />[size=3]The [i]light [/i]magic effect has been replaced with a Skyrim-style [i]magelight [/i]effect. Using the new [i]magelight [/i]effect creates an orb of light that will follow and float around you and other actors. Casting the [i]magelight [/i]on a target location will create an orb of light at the location for the duration of the spell. The intensity of the light depends on the magnitude of the spell. You can create new spells and enchantments with the new [i]magelight [/i]effect, as well as use it on existing spells and enchantments. Each time the game is started, all usage of the vanilla [i]light [/i]effect will be replaced with the new [i]magelight[/i], making this mod fully compatible with any mods that add light-based spells or enchantments. Watch the video for a full demonstration of the new mechanics!\n<br />\n<br />[/size][size=3]Please be aware that there may be some lighting issues that occur on a rare occasion. This can be due to constraints in the vanilla light engine or issues with meshes. You can safely ignore these lighting issues.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[size=3]This mod does use an ESP. This mod IS NOT compatible with OpenMW, at least until support for MWSE mods is added.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][b]Magic Mechanics Mod Series[/b][/size]\n<br />[size=3]The Magic Mechanics mod series is a collection of mods that expand, improve and alter the vanilla Morrowind magic system in various ways.
