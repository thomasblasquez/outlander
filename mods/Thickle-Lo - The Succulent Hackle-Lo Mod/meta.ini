nexusDescription="[center]\xfeff[img]https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/q1mgt3uhli0bwwb/Promo_Logo.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]In the game, hackle-lo leaves are described as \"[font=Courier New]a tasty edible succulent leaf of the Grazelands, prized both for its taste and its roborative powers.[/font]\" And yet the leaves appear to be flat and not reminiscent of a succulent. This mod edits the plants and ingredients to be thicker. The ingredient is now a single leaf split in half to reveal the tasty flesh inside that locals like to chew after a long day's work. The plants are slightly more detailed than vanilla but won't stand out in a vanilla install aside from the improvements I have mentioned. Compatible with texture replacers.\n<br />\n<br />* * *\n<br />\n<br />[/size]I recommend using this mod with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47469]Remiros' Intelligent Textures[/url]\xfeff and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46599]Graphic Herbalism MWSE Edition[/url]\xfeff.[/center][center]\xfeff[img]https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/66xnsgmje9hqk9o/Promo_Footer.png[/img]\xfeff[/center]"
