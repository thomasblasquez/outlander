nexusDescription="[size=3]Tel Branora is a fascinating town: a Telvanni tower adorned with kwama eggs, NPCs wandering in full Dwemer armor, a slave rebellion, and a group of Telvanni scheming to overthrow Therana. This mod is a small overhaul of Tel Branora, designed to expand on the theme of it being a remote and alien Telvanni settlement, ruled by a mad and powerful sorceress.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Additions:[/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][b]Spider tunnels in the tower dungeon[/b]: Based on Therana's dialogue, it seems there should be spiders lurking somewhere in the dungeon. Here's a vanilla dialogue example: [i]\"Hmph. Mustn't be rude, now. It's Mistress Therana speaking to you. And when Mistress Therana speaks, everyone LISTENS. Don't they? Because if they don't, then they get very stiff and get stuck way down in BASEMENT WITH THE SPIDERS.\"\xa0[/i]\n<br />[/list][list]\n<br />[*][b]An extravagant alchemy shop[/b]: While not strongly rooted in lore, I wanted to create an impressive alchemy shop, and Tel Branora seemed like the perfect place. It\x2019s exactly the kind of settlement where you\x2019\x64 expect to find a highly skilled alchemist.\n<br />[/list][list]\n<br />[*][b]Expanded docks[/b]: Tel Branora originally had just two shacks. Now, there are two more, along with additional fishing-related clutter, giving the docks a more lively and fleshed-out appearance.\n<br />[/list][list]\n<br />[*][b]New Telvanni boat model[/b]: A new, organic-style boat model by Dim replaces the generic Nordic longboat found in vanilla. The boat is adorned with lanterns, fishing gear, ropes, and more, adding to Tel Branora's alien and distinct atmosphere.\n<br />[/list][list]\n<br />[*][b]Optional addon with new misc quests[/b]: This addon includes quests adapted from the old mod [i][url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220805191751/https://mw.modhistory.com/download-21-8799]Tales of Tel Branora[/url]\xfeff[/i]. I\x2019ve polished the dialogue, removed quests I didn\x2019t like, and modified one to give players a reason to explore the spider tunnels.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[b]Conclusion\n<br />[/b]Though it's a small mod, I\x2019m proud to share it with the community. I hope you enjoy the new additions to Tel Branora. Cheers!\n<br />\n<br />[b]Compatibility[/b]\n<br />Compatiblewith BCoM, but don\x2019t use the boat addon as that\x2019s already included in BCoM[list]\n<br />[/list][/size]"
