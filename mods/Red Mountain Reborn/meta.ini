It's beautiful work, but Morrowind Rebirth is a massive mod for a player to commit to wit[/size][size=3]h tons of changes to the game world that make it incompatible with most mods not designed specifically with Rebirth in mind. I have always been jealous of Trancemaster's beautiful rendition of the mountain, so... [/size][i]I've kidnapped it.\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.ibb.co/9tPdmsv/Mountain-Rise.jpg[/img][/i]\n<br />\n<br />[i][b][size=3]Red Mountain Reborn[/size][/b][/i][size=3] is Trancemaster's Red Mountain, but I've cut along the dotted line and stitched it into the vanilla landscape. The landscape edits are restricted only to the Red Mountain region and the bordering Ashlands region cells. It was tedious work making the landscape and shading flow right and I am *not* a particularly incredible exterior editor, but I'm hoping I got everything up to a standard that does Trancemaster's work justice. It was really incredible for him to give me permission to do this and the whole time I was toiling away stitching and painting, I was also excited to get this done to give to all of you.\n<br />\n<br />[b]To address a common point of confusion:[/b]\xa0you can use this mod on its own without having to use any of the other included patches. I have received more than one request to make a version of this mod without the dwemer tower at the peak of the mountain (from DNGDR). The reality is, [i]this version already exists[/i]. It's the base version of the mod that you can see in the above screen as well as a few screens in the gallery! Enjoy.\n<br />\n<br />[b][i]Version 1.1[/i][/b] of Red Mountain Reborn has one small fix for a problem I believe it inherited from Morrowind Rebirth. The script attached to the door into Dagoth Ur was busted - not a showstopping bug, but you had to get the door to glitch out to actually get past it which was not ideal. Now it works like every other dwemer door.\n<br />\n<br />I have included [b]several patches[/b] with version 1.1 of the mod so that hopefully RMR can fit into more installs. All patches are \".esp replacers\". Use my versions instead of the ones that came with the mod, but do note that you need the original mods installed as I have not included any of their assets. If you are using a mod manager, RMR's versions should automatically replace them. Simple.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.ibb.co/BChmb51/dngdr.jpg[/img]\n<br />[size=6]Darknut's Greater Dwemer Ruins v1.2.1\n<br />[/size][size=3][i]You must download this mod separately\xa0in order for the included patch to work. Get it [u][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43544]here[/url][/u].[/i]\n<br />This is a patch hand-made by me - it was just easier for me to do that than to try and make Darknut's Rebirth patch work. I have tested all of the doors to make sure things line up right and so far as I can tell it's all good. I don't play Morrowind without GDR. I highly recommend it.\n<br />\n<br />[/size][b][i][size=3]New in version 1.1:[/size][/i][/b] [size=3]A patch for GDR v1.2.1 to make it work with both Red Mountain Reborn and Solstheim - Tomb of the Snow Prince has been included. The incompatibility between these two mods seems to have been mostly overlooked. To keep from spoiling things too much, I will only say that DNGDR adds one small detail to Solstheim that only the most dedicated explorers will find. Now, you can find that same detail in HOTV's version of Solstheim.\n<br />[/size][i][size=3]You must download Solstheim - Tomb of the Snow Prince separately in order for the included patch to work. Get it [u][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46810]here[/url][/u].[/size][/i]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b][i]PLEASE NOTE:[/i][/b]\xa0[/size][size=3]A patch for DNGDR v1.2 is also available as an [/size][b]alternative file[/b][size=3]\xa0under downloads. If you use 1.2 and not 1.2.1, use that instead. You don't need to download the v1.2 patch if you're using v1.2.1 since that one is [b]included[/b] in the main download. Also of note, no patch exists for DNGDR v1.2 + RMR + TOTSP.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.ibb.co/K7mTHHy/ghostgatefortress.jpg[/img]\n<br />[/size][size=6]Resdayn Revival Team's Ghostgate Fortress[/size]\n<br />[size=3][i]You must download this mod separately\xa0in order for the included patch to work. Get it [u][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45822]here[/url][/u].[/i]\n<br />Everything is intact. I only patched the English .esp. I would be more than willing to include the russian version with this archive if one was produced, but I'm not handy with dialog editing and doing the tedious work to make a second patch was just too overwhelming for me. Please forgive me.\n<br />\n<br />[b][i]New in version 1.1:[/i][/b] I have adjusted some mesh placements in the exterior around the Ghostgate where previously things were floating very slightly or clipping badly.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.ibb.co/B4DT01b/foyada1.jpg[/img]\n<br />[size=6]Remiros' Foyada Mamaea Overhaul[/size]\n<br />[size=3][i]You must download this mod separately\xa0in order for the included patch to work. Get it [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46424][u]here[/u][/url].[/i][/size]\n<br />[size=3]I believe this excellent mod by Remiros' is compatible with the base version of RMR, but it has landscape conflicts with RMR + RR Ghostgate Fortress. Therefor, I have created a patch to smooth out those seams so that all 3 can be used together.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.ibb.co/vQTsYdM/kogoruhnexpanded.jpg[/img]\n<br />[size=6]Team Drama Kwama's Kogoruhn Expanded\xa0[/size]\n<br />[size=3][i]You must download this mod separately\xa0in order for the included patch to work. Get it [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46098][u]here[/u][/url].[/i]\n<br />Another mod that is situated\xa0\x63lose to Red Mountain, another set of landscape seams for me to stitch up. Care was taken to ensure the landscape flowed correctly.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.ibb.co/GnftgR3/illuminatedorder.jpg[/img]\n<br />[size=6]Mort's Charles J DeVito's\xa0Illuminated Order 2.0 - Lore Friendly[/size]\n<br />[i]You must download this mod separately\xa0in order for the included patch to work. Get it [u][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47414]here[/url][/u].[/i]\n<br />This is for Mort's Illuminated Order 2.0 Lore Friendly .esp. This mod adds a small building to Red Mountain, so I cleaned up the seams around it. The \"Lore Friendly\" version is the one I use so it's the one I patched. Highly recommended.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.ibb.co/nrXHdTH/sheogorad2.jpg[/img]\n<br />[size=6]Compatibility notes for other mods...\n<br />[/size][size=3]I have tried to keep cell edits to their absolute bare minimum. That said, any mod that makes landscape edits in or around Red Mountain Region and the Ghostfence are extremely likely to leave seams behind. If a mod does NOT make landscape edits, the probability\xa0that it is compatible is extremely high. For as different as it looks, Trancemaster's Red Mountain actually does not drastically change a whole lot of landscape outside of the peak at Dagoth Ur and what was previously a smaller \"hill\" near the Ghostgate. All of the Dwemer Ruins besides Dagoth Ur are actually in their original locations, for example. To give you an idea, to patch DNGDR I only needed to move the tower, not all the other ruins.\n<br />\n<br />This is what I hope to become a growing list of mods that exist in or near Red Mountain and are known to be compatible with RMR either through an included patch or just because they don't edit the landscape or are actually far enough away...\n<br />\n<br />RandomPal's [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48766]Ald'Ruhn - Seat of Power of House Redoran[/url]\xfeff has a patch for RMR included. I highly recommend it, and you should check out his other city overhauls, too.\n<br />Leyawynn's [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46691]Valley of the Wind Overhaul[/url] is compatible with no patch required. It doesn't have any landscape edits and I didn't find anything wrong with it.\n<br />Trainwiz'\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43399]Endusal and Tureynulal Redone[/url]\xfeff is compatible with no patch required. All of its edits seem to be interior only.\n<br />...if you have any suggestions for this list, please sound off in the comments, and if you find a mod that is not compatible, feel free also to request that one is made.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.ibb.co/B6mTq7z/Mountain-Sun.jpg[/img]"
