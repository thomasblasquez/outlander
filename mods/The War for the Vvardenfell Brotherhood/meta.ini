nexusDescription="[size=6][center]The War for the Vvardenfell Brotherhood[/center][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][b]Introduction[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Indulge in a story about the Dark Brotherhood's eastern civil war, the rise of the Mythic Dawn, and the fall of Severa Magia. \n<br />\n<br />[size=3]This epic allows you to join the Vvardenfell branch of the Dark Brotherhood in Morrowind.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />You'll find yourself recruited into a faction caught in a war with itself and the Morag Tong, while also trying to appease allies in the growing Cult of Mehrunes Dagon. Nothing is ever as it seems in this story. There are many hidden truths and roles you can play in the chaos that is the War for the Vvardenfell Brotherhood. But be careful - the Prophet of Sithis is hunting you from the shadows. The Shadowscale Usha-Madesi has you in his sights, and he will stop at nothing to see the destruction of you and the brotherhood that has strayed too far from the tenants.\n<br />\n<br />This is not just a Dark Brotherhood story, this is very much a story leading up to the events of [i]The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. [/i]This mod also references works from other Crown projects.\n<br />[i]\n<br />[/i] Within the story, there are four possible angles you can take:\n<br />\n<br />[/size][list]\n<br />[*][size=3]You can be a loyal servant of Sithis, brought into the fray of uncertain times.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Or, maybe an assassin-turned follower of Mehrunes Dagon, loyal to the Camorans.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Or, more simply, you could be a killer, simply out for their own benefit of power.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Or, maybe secretly, an agent of Mephala, determined with taking actions into their own hands.[/size]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[size=3]There are four different possible endings, all of which preserve canon, and therefore by my own definition - this mod is lore-friendly.[/size][size=3][b]\n<br />\n<br />Features[/b] - Begin by asking for the latest rumors in Gnisis or Ald Velothi [b]OR[/b] by following the Morag Tong questline.\n<br />\n<br />[/size][list]\n<br />[*][size=3]30 new quests.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]50+ new NPCs.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Multiple endings.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]An awesome villain.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]A new joinable faction.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Opportunities to roleplay.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]30,000+ words of new dialogue.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Several easter eggs and references.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3][size=3]Talk to Daedra in friendly shrines.[/size][/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]New lore that fits seamlessly with vanilla.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Populated and cluttered shrines to Mehrunes Dagon.[/size]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />There's a walkthrough under the \"Articles\" section.[size=3]\n<br />[b]Requirements and Compatibility[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46063]Greetings for No Lore[/url] (included in [size=3][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/55615]Crown Document Analysis[/url]\xfeff[/size]) is a soft requirement, since I did not wish to add multiple greetings to all fifty plus NPCs. You can use this mod without it, but get ready to see the same three greetings on every miscellaneous NPC.\n<br />\n<br />This is compatible with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49231]Beautiful Cities of Morrowind[/url].\n<br />\n<br />This is compatible with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/54679?]Daedric Shrine Overhaul[/url].\n<br />\n<br />This is compatible with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47041]Morag Tong Polished[/url] / [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/55615]Crown Document Analysis[/url].\n<br />\n<br />This is compatible with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/53919]Maar Gan - Town of Pilgrimage[/url].\n<br />\n<br />Here's the load order:\n<br />\n<br />1. The Doors of Oblivion 1.4.esp\n<br />2. Beautiful Cities of Morrowind.esp\n<br />3. Daedric Shrine Overhaul FULL.esp\n<br />4. Morag Tong Polished.esp // Crown Document Analysis.esp\n<br />5. Vvardenfell Brotherhood.esp\n<br />6. VB - MTP Polished Integration.esp (recommended)\n<br />\n<br />I recommend using all of the above.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Mods that Conflict[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Zelazko made a[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48874] \"To Serve Sithis\" crossover mod[/url]. This does not work with the latest version, however I have preserved the old version for this reason. It's not really needed anymore in the latest version, because I did my own thing with Lucien Lachance.\n<br />\n<br />This mod is *unlikely* to be compatible with:\n<br />[/size][list]\n<br />[*][size=3]Mods that overhaul shrines to Mehrunes Dagon. *Indoranyon is okay.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Some LGNPC mods, as this modifies dialogue for some vanilla NPCs.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Mods that add hostile NPCs to dungeons, because certain Daedric Shrines are made \x2018tame\x2019 when the player joins the Vvardenfell Brotherhood faction.[/size]\n<br />[/list][size=3]\n<br />[/size][center][size=3][b]I hope you enjoy this nifty mod,\n<br />- Caeris.[/b][/size][/center]"
