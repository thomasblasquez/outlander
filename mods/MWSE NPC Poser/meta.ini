nexusDescription="[b]MWSE NPC Poser\n<br />\n<br />[/b]This is a simple mwse mod to apply some idle animations to NPCs.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />I was inspired to make this due to playing with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/53036]Merlord's Joy of Painting[/url]--I wanted to paint lots of portraits, but everyone was just standing there doing nothing!\n<br />\n<br />This mod will let you change that.\n<br />\n<br />The mod includes a variety of idle animation nifs (Credit to Qarl, RX31, and Vidi Aquam for most of these resources), and implements a hotkey which will let you load these animations onto NPCs\n<br />\n<br />To play, set the hotkey in the MCM (U by default).\n<br />\n<br />With an NPC in your reticle, press the button \xfeffwhile holding ALT to cycle through the animation nifs. Hold alt and control to cycle backwards. Press the hotkey with no modifier to load the animation onto the targeted NPC.\n<br />\n<br />Press the hotkey with SHIFT to cycle through idles animations--in morrowind each nif has like 9 idle anims, shift will let you cycle through them. Many of the nifs will just have vanilla idles at lower values, so check the higher values if the animation doesn't seem to do anything.\n<br />\n<br />If those controls sound sort of clunky, well, they are, but I just wanted a simple way to make npcs pose.\n<br />\n<br />CREDITS:\n<br />I collected some idle animation resources I knew of. The mod includes assets from:\n<br />\n<br />RX31's Groovy Moves series (dance idles)\n<br />RX31's Miscellaneous moves and poses\n<br />Vidi Aquam's sitting mod\n<br />Qarl's animations\n<br />\n<br />There are quite a lot of nifs included, and some of them might be too silly for you to want to use (RX31's animations include a lot of variants on people standing around looking drunk or barfing, and a lot of wacky dances)--if you want fewer options cluttering up the controls you can go into main.lua in mwse/mods/lack/NPCposer and delete the file names you don't want in the \"nifs\" array, and optionally delete the nifs themselves from the meshes/lp folder"
