nexusDescription="Updated to 1.2: Fixed an instance of a minor, non-recurring bug.\r\n\r\nMake sure the version you use is 1.2. \r\n\r\nThis mod alters the way Morrowind vampires work, and makes them more lore-appropriate as far as the rest of the Elder Scrolls go.\r\n\r\nYou will progress through four stages of the disease, (day by day) getting more powerful as each day goes on, but you will also take more sun damage, more fire damage, and upon reaching the fourth stage, NPCs will know you are a vampire, and react appropriately.\r\n\r\nFeeding on the living brings this back to the first stage.\r\n\r\nYou will be able to do all story quests, barter, stay at inns, and do everything you normally would, while being a vampire.\r\n\r\nEssentially makes vampires function like they do in Oblivion.  Does not overpower.  Keeps the original balance (at their most powerful in my mod, vampires are equal to their power in vanilla Morrowind.)\r\n\r\nAll the important details, as well as bugs, known issues, and compatibility issues are in the included readme.  Read it.  :)"
