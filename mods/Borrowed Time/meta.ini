nexusDescription="[size=3][b]Introduction[/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />Fortify Health is a terrible effect, even with MCP fix. When it expires and your health is below its magnitude, it immediately kills you. The possible applications for such effect is ridicullously small. Either you didn't need it, or you should have casted healing spell instead. On the other hand, there is Drain Health, which allows to instantly kill anyone very cheap, totally ignoring the duration setting.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][b]Description[/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />Using MWSE lua, this mod fixes these two effects in an easy way. Now they won't be able to kill anyone by themselves. When the Fortyfy Health Effect ends or Drain Health Effect begins, actors will be left with at least one health point.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][b]My other gameplay mods[/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50574]Buying Game[/url] - trade system and mercantile skill overhaul.\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49086]Silver Tongue[/url]\xfeff - improves gameplay and UI for Speechcraft.\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48528]Locks and Traps Detection[/url] - makes Security Skill more interesting and important\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48317]Sneaky Strike[/url] - makes daggers more usefull for sneak attacks than longswords\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48251]Nimble Armor[/url] - makes armor affect your chance to evade attacks\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49036]Alchemical Knowledge[/url] - improves alchemy UI and gameplay\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49010/]Class Starting Spells[/url]\xfeff - gives personalized spells for all classes\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48989]Class Skill Limit[/url]\xfeff - restricts your development outside chosen class"
