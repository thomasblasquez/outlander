nexusDescription="[size=3][b]Note:[/b][b]\xa0[/b]This mod was created for the vanilla game, and will\xa0[u]NOT[/u]\xa0work on OpenMW!\n<br />\n<br />[b]HEY YOU![/b]\n<br />Do you hate running into modded items that are overpowered?\n<br />Do you hate tediously editing item stats in the Construction Set?\n<br />If you said 'yes' to either of those questions, then this is the mod for you!\n<br />\n<br />[b]Description:[/b]\n<br />Zilophos' Item Editor, or ZIE for short, is a utility tool built with MWSE that is designed to give modders and players alike total control over the items, powers, and spell effects in their game. ZIE provides players with an in-game item editor that can be used to edit item stats on-the-fly as you play, which are updated in real time. No need to restart Morrowind for the changes to take effect. Save bloat is also not an issue, as all changes are global and saved within the mod's config file. This config file can also be shared, allowing you to share your balance changes with others. Essentially, it's a MWSE alternative to making balance patches via the Construction Set.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Usage:[/b]\n<br />1. Open the mod config menu in-game, and navigate to the Zilophos' Item Editor MCM.\n<br />2. Find and select your item from the given categories.\n<br />3. Edit the stats as you see fit, and save your changes.\n<br />\n<br />If you make a mistake, items can also be reset to their default values in the MCM. You could also edit the mod config file directly.\n<br />\n<br />There are some limitations, however!\n<br />You should not attempt to edit any save-specific records. That means things like player-created spells, potions, and enchanted items. Attempting to edit save-specific records is likely to cause problems and break mod functionality.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Credits:[/b]\n<br />&gt; [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/18092484?tab=about+me]Zilophos[/url] - for the original concept, banner art, and some fixes.\n<br />&gt;\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/140139148]Spammer21[/url]\xa0-\xfeff whose hard work and MWSE knowledge made this mod possible!\n<br />&gt; The MMC - for scripting help and aiding in troubleshooting.\n<br />[color=#FFD914]\n<br />[b]Disclaimer: [/b]It is highly unlikely this mod will get updates past v1.3, as I lack the time and scripting knowledge to improve it further. However, anyone willing to continue work on this is freely open to do so! If anyone contributes more to this mod, I'd be happy to host those files here on the main page.
