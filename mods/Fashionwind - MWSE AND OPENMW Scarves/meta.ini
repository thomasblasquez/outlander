nexusDescription="This mod adds fashionable scarves for your character to the game, unlike my previous fashionwind mods this one actually does work with openmw however the openmw version works differently.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />I AM NOT GOING TO EXPLAIN THIS TO ANYONE IN THE COMMENTS SO PLEASE READ CAREFULLY!!\n<br />\n<br />MWSE VERSION:\n<br />In the MWSE version these scarves work as they do in my other onion fashionwind mods, you will be able to wear them alongside helmets and other fashionwind accessories simultaneously.\xa0\xa0\n<br />\n<br />OPENMW/ Non MWSE VERSION\n<br />this is essentially a non mwse version, these scarves use different models (but the same textures) as they function as helmets and completely conceal the neck. they cannot be worn with helmets or any other headgear but they wont hide your hair.\n<br />\n<br />You can buy these scarves from the new merchant in the ald-ruhn under skar clothier (the one wearing a scarf)\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Credits:\xa0\n<br />Safebox - for onion framework\n<br />Axeljk- for the original cloth helm model\n<br />remiros - for Intelligent textures\xa0\n<br />Morrowind Enhanced Textures team - for\xa0Morrowind Enhanced Textures\n<br />\n<br />All of my mods free for anyone to use as a resource for what ever you want\n<br />and free for anyone to translate and host on other sites, as long\n<br />as you give credit.\n<br />\n<br />If I've made a mistake of some kind, please let me know and I'll do my best to solve it.\n<br />\n<br />you can keep up to date with me and my workings by following me on\xa0[url=https://twitter.com/RVangarr]this terrible website[/url]"
