nexusDescription="This mod adds the functionality of [url=http://mw.modhistory.com/download-15-12776]Improved Inns[/url] to the newrentable rooms added by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45410/]The Publicans [/url]and by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/36017]AST Syeda Neen Attic Addon[/url] (which is the best\n<br />mod \x2013 in my opinion - among those that add a rentable bed to the Arille\x2019s Tradehouse).\n<br />\n<br />For anyone who\x2019s not familiar with the original mod, theseare the main changes:\n<br />\n<br />-\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0You can now rent a bed for more than 1 single day\n<br />-\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Room rental gets updated in real time\n<br />\n<br />Vanilla scripts only fire during a cell change, which means you could potentially remain in a rented room forever, as long as you didn't change cell. With this mod, if the rental period has expired, the publican will wake you up or kick you out of\xa0 the room!\n<br />\n<br />Since it was impossible to make patches (i.e. additional esps) I merged everything into a single esp.\n<br />\n<br />While I was at it, I fixed a big issue with improved inns: the author of the original mod added the new dialogue option to rent a room for more than just a day to every single publican by adding an unfiltered dialogue option.\n<br />\n<br />This means that every single publican in the game offered you the new option but since mod-added publicans are not scripted to work with\n<br />improved inns, this would break the rent functionality of every mod-added inn.\n<br />\n<br />This has been [b]fixed [/b]by adding filtered entries for everysingle publican.\n<br />\n<br />[b]UPDATE 1.4\n<br />[/b]As of version 1.4 a new feature has been implemented. Now when you rent a room you can also use empty containers in it. Another feature that I think should have been already in the base game.\n<br />\xa0\n<br />[b]THERE\x2019S MORE[/b]\n<br />While I was at it, I made a compatibility patch between this mod and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44764]Entertainers Expanded[/url]. \n<br />The latest expansion of this plugin by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46889]Chantox [/url]makes the underwhelming official plugin fun for roleplay.\n<br />This version of the mod needs to be used alongside the Entertainers Expanded (and Entertainers expanded again if you want) and needs to be loaded\n<br />AFTER it.\n<br />\xa0\n<br />[b]PTR COMPATIBILITY AND SUPPORT[/b]\n<br />Both the improved inns functionality and the ability toperform have been added to every inn from the latest version of Tamriel\n<br />Rebuilt, Skyrim Home of the Nords and Project Cyrodiil.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3]========================\n<br />Installation Preparation\n<br />========================[/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Improved Inns Expanded incorporates all the features of the following Mods\n<br />\n<br />\"Improved Inns\" http://mw.modhistory.com/download-15-12776\n<br />\"The Publicans\" https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45410\n<br />\"AST Seyda Neen Arrilles Attic Addon\" https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/36017\n<br />\n<br />You must disable or remove those 3 mods from your load list before installing .\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3]=============\n<br />Install Order\n<br />=============[/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Entertainers Expanded (optional)\n<br />Entertainers Expanded Again (optional)\n<br />\n<br />Beautiful cities of morrowind.esp (optional)\n<br />BCOM Suran Expansion.ESP (optional)\n<br />\n<br />Improved Inns Expanded (choose the correct plugin below)\n<br />\n<br />[b]=============\n<br />Which Plugin?\n<br />=============[/b]\n<br />\n<br />1.
